Issue-5377: Implemented `available()` for ReaderInputStream,P3 cla: yes package=io status=triaged type=enhancement,Marcono1234,,"1c3t3a: This PR adds an implementation of available() for the ReaderInputStream class. The implementation follows the suggestions of issue #5377..Marcono1234: Implementing this method is rather tricky, I have left some review comments which are hopefully helpful for you.
Maybe it would be good to wait for feedback from some of the maintainers to know if implementing this method is really worth it.
It might be good to add some tests (possibly with the example code snippets I provide) to CharSourceTester.java (I hope that is the right test class).
And to add this change also to the Android version of ReaderInputStream..1c3t3a: Allright, thank you very much for the detailed feedback! We implement a first version of what you described. We added a flushing case were the encoder gets flushed and we also now check for the CoderResult we receive when calling encode(). But running your test always produces an OVERFLOW when encoding to the buffer, even if we enlarged it with calling startDraining(). For clarity we committed our latest code and plan  to work on this in the next days..google-cla: All (the pull request submitter and all commit authors) CLAs are signed, but one or more commits were authored or co-authored by someone other than the pull request submitter.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..kariustobias: @googlebot I consent..Marcono1234: Thanks! I think this looks quite good now, though I am not a maintainer of this project and they might have other requirements.
Maybe it would be good to have a test in CharSourceTester like the following:
public void testAsByteSource_openStream() throws IOException {
  Charset charset = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
  byte[] expectedBytes = expected.getBytes(charset);
  ByteArrayOutputStream actualBytes = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

  InputStream inputStream = source.asByteSource(charset).openStream();

  while (actualBytes.size() < expectedBytes.length) {
    assertTrue(inputStream.available() > 0);
    int b = inputStream.read();
    if (b == -1) {
      break;
    }
    actualBytes.write(b);
  }

  assertEquals(0, in.available());
  assertArrayEquals(expectedBytes, actualBytes.toByteArray());
}
For the current test you added, it might be easier to have the more sophisticated tests which rely on certain buffer sizes in a separate test class (ReaderInputStreamTest) so that they can specify the buffer size (and CodingErrorAction if necessary) directly for ReaderInputStream instead of relying on implementation details of other classes..cgdecker: I haven't looked at the code yet, but I'm not really sure this is worth doing given that it sounds like it's not especially simple to implement.

FEATURE: add tools for merging of maps,P3 cla: yes package=collect type=addition,,,"hosuaby: The present PR adds methods for merging of maps.
Merging of maps is an operation that combines content of two or more maps into a new map while handles entries with duplicate key. Example:
    Map<String, Set<String>> tags1 = ImmutableMap.of(
            ""guava"", newHashSet(""java"", ""collections""),
            ""junit"", newHashSet(""tests""));
    Map<String, Set<String>> tags2 = ImmutableMap.of(
            ""spring"", newHashSet(""di"", ""boot""),
            ""junit"", newHashSet(""runner"", ""platform""));

    Map<String, Set<String>> merged = Maps.merge(tags1, tags2, Sets::union);

    // Result: {
    //    ""guava"": [""java"", ""collections""]
    //    ""spring"": [""di"", ""boot""]
    //    ""junit"": [""tests"", ""runner"", ""platform""]
    // }
The present PR add new methods to class Maps:

Map merge(firstMap, secondMap, mergeFunction) - merges two maps
Map mergeAll(mergeFunction, firstMap, Map... otherMaps) - merges multiple maps, using signature with varagrs
Map mergeAll(mergeFunction, Iterable maps) - merges multiple maps
Collector mergeCollector(Collector<V, ?, V> downstream) - creates a collector able to merge stream of maps

Real life use-case:
Assuming we have multiple data sources that returns data in form of maps. We would like to aggregate those data by merging those maps. Unit tests give us an example using measurements provided by different sources..jbduncan: @hosuaby I'm not a member of the Guava team or even a Googler, just so that you're aware, but have you considered merging your maps together like the following?
// If you're able to turn your Map<String, Set<String>>s into SetMultimap<String, String>s beforehand:
var merged = 
    ImmutableSetMultimap.builder()
        .putAll(multimapTags1)
        .putAll(multimapTags2)
        .build();

// Otherwise:
var merged =
    Stream.of(tags1, tags2)
        .flatMap(tags -> tags.entries().stream())
        .collect(toImmutableSetMultimap(Entry::getKey, Entry::getValue));.jbduncan: Oops, sorry, I didn't realise that one of my examples above prints the wrong value! Here's my updated code snippet:
// If you're able to turn your Map<String, Set<String>>s into SetMultimap<String, String>s beforehand:
var merged =
    ImmutableSetMultimap.builder()
        .putAll(multiTags1)
        .putAll(multiTags2)
        .build();

// Otherwise:
var merged =
    Stream.of(tags1, tags2)
        .flatMap(tags -> tags.entrySet().stream())
        .collect(flatteningToImmutableSetMultimap(Entry::getKey, entry -> entry.getValue().stream()));.hosuaby: Hello, @jbduncan
Thanks for review!
It's all the question of simplicity. In your example, the user must ""prepare"" the maps by converting them into SetMultimap beforehand. Feature provided by present PR doesn't have such requirements. All methods accept input maps ""as is"", mutable or immutable.
The second point, in your example, We are looking to merge maps of Map<K, Set<V>> or Map<K, List<V>>. Methods in the present PR are able to merge values of any compatible types. It unit tests, I merge maps of Map<String, ? extend Number>.
But, thank you for your suggestion of MultiMaps. I refactored implementation of methods using ImmutableListMultiMap and it became much shorter.
If you have, any questions, suggestions, objections do not hesitate to comment. I try my best to make those tools the most generic and convenient to as much use-cases as possible..jbduncan: @hosuaby Okay, thanks for explaining!
If or when the Guava team get around to reviewing this, the first thing that they'll probably say is they'll need to internally discuss the API first, as mentioned in the contribution docs and the project philosophy. And even then there's no guarantee it will end up in Guava, because they may think that existing APIs, like in my example above, are good enough.
Just so that you're warned. :).ogregoire: The biggest question would come from the resolution of conflicts. You are conveniently speaking about Map<X, Set<Y>> which has a rather trivial resolution, but what about any Map<X, Collection<Y>>. Do you want one entry, several entries?
I believe that you'd be best using Maps::difference. Ok, it's just a bit of work compared to a simple helper method, but it'll get your work done rather easily..hosuaby: @ogregoire That's what mergeFunction made for. We can specify which collection we want (in case, we merge Map<X, Collection<Y>>:
  public void testGithub() {
    Map<String, Collection<String>> tags1 = ImmutableMap.of(
            ""guava"", newHashSet(""java"", ""collections""));

    Map<String, Collection<String>> tags2 = ImmutableMap.of(
            ""guava"", newHashSet(""optionals"", ""java"", ""library""));

    Map<String, Collection<String>> asSet = Maps.merge(tags1, tags2, (c1, c2) -> newHashSet(Iterables.concat(c1, c2)));
    assertThat(asSet.get(""guava"")).hasSize(4);
    assertThat(asSet.get(""guava"")).containsExactly(""java"", ""collections"", ""optionals"", ""library"");

    Map<String, Collection<String>> asList = Maps.merge(tags1, tags2, (c1, c2) -> newArrayList(Iterables.concat(c1, c2)));
    assertThat(asList.get(""guava"")).hasSize(5);

Issue #3742 Changing the axesSizeProduct entries to Integer.MAX_VALUE instead of throwing exception,P3 cla: yes package=collect type=enhancement,,,"HelenaGregg: #3742 said that they would like to be able to create a Sets::cartesianProduct object that would have more than 2^31-1 elements in the resulting set. Currently, it throws an IllegalArgumentException when this happens. @Meijuh said that since ""java.util.Set::size() specifies that if the size would be more than Integer.MAX_VALUE it would simply be Integer.MAX_VALUE"" this should be fixed.
So the code change is that instead of throwing an exception, the remaining lower parts of the axesSizeProduct integer array are set to Integer.MAX_VALUE so the size function (which returns axesSizeProduct[0]) will now return Integer.MAX_VALUE..lowasser: Several other methods are defined in terms of axesSizeProduct and make assumptions about how it works, so please add tests for them; I suspect that several of them are broken in the current version.
In particular, iterator and contains.  (Further thinking about this brought up #3873 and #3874 .)
In particular:

I'm not sure List.indexOf is well-defined for a list of size greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE, so we'd have to make a decision what to do there.  I prefer throwing IndexOutOfBoundsException, if only because Objects.equal(list.get(list.indexOf(o)), o) should always be true if index is not -1, and list.indexOf(o) >= 0 should be as equivalent as possible to list.contains(o).  (Note that this change also affects Lists.cartesianProduct, so indexOf is a method that needs to be supported.
The iterator needs to return the next element after you've called next Integer.MAX_VALUE times.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that can be tested without being very slow, and I don't know how to solve that.
contains definitely needs to be tested, including on elements whose ""index"" would be greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE.  That probably means it needs a new implementation separate from indexOf, which would ideally also address #3873.",2020-04-22T01:05:41Z,None,6,3,4

Might be worth checking first whether you can call getDeclaredMethods and if not to use clazz.getMethods as your sole source of methods.
Stylistically: I find the two streams within each other to be really awkward. The previous version with regular loops was much more clear IMHO. Streams work out nicely when you have a small filter-and-transform thing going on but nesting them makes it difficult to remember where one is located.
I also find it awkward that the Set identifiers is just used for a uniqueness check (filter on L205) vs. how the map was used to determine the results in the end. Also just for reference the filter call on L192 that always returns true could be turned into a peek..vrozov: Any plan to pull this into a release?",2020-04-10T20:33:35Z,None,2,1,6

I began looking into this when trying to find a way to make my apps existing LoadingCache<K, V> populate itself with all of the possible keys and values it could from my database table, in my use case the input data is dynamic and contains keys which may or may not have a value in the database however, the database table is quite small and could easily be completely stored in memory and refreshed at a set interval, this will reduce the number of calls my app needs to make to the database exponentially(>10k requests per minute to 1 request per 15 minutes).
While searching I came across this issue #775 which is exactly the same problem I am trying to solve but I fear there was some confusion in the reasons why and the use case.
I would prefer if there was an implementation of LoadingCache that had these semantics but for now I thought a smaller change would be to add an extra implementation to memoized suppliers.
I am aware that the tests here are less than idea, I just followed the convention from the tests of the expiring memoizer which uses Thread.sleep.
There is a good chance I've missed something which exists that does exactly what I require so if you know if it please tell me üòÑ",2020-01-22T09:01:21Z,None,1,0,3

One thing I noticed while writing this is that com.google.common.util.concurrent.Internal#toNanosSaturated is package-scoped internal, but the only method in there is applicable to all legacy API's that require a long, TimeUnit, and there are several scattered in base, cache, and collect under com.google.common.

Publish Gradle Module Metadata with Variants,P3 cla: yes package=general type=other,"cpovirk,cgdecker",cpovirk,"jjohannes: Hello again from Gradle üëã
The following is a suggestion open for discussion. I provide this as a PR, instead of an issue only, as a proof of concept to aid the discussion.
Background
With the release of Gradle 6, Gradle fully supports a new metadata format called Gradle Module Metadata (GMM) - docs and spec. Such a metadata (.module) file can be published in addition to a .pom file and Gradle 6 will use it to obtain additional information about a library, its artifacts and transitive dependencies which can not be represented in the pom format. The GMM format has been under development at Gradle since about two years. With the release of Gradle 6, we are now at a point where it is ready to be adopted in larger scale. That's why we have been looking at popular JVM libraries, like Guava, to evaluate if Gradle users depending on a library would profit if the library would publish GMM.
Why should Guava care?
There are a couple of things Guava struggles with to express in their poms. Many of which have already been discussed at length here in other issues. I set up a repository with samples demonstrating these use cases. In detail, GMM offers modeling concepts, and with that solutions, for the following:
Multiple variants in one component
Use case with description: guava-jdk-variants
At the core of Gradle 6 dependency management and GMM is the notion that a component can have multiple, and arbitrary many, variants. A concept Gradle has been adopting since 3.x internally and which is heavily used already by all Gradle JVM plugins to distinguish between runtime and compile time variants and to a larger extend, for example, by the Android build system or by Kotlin Native.
Guava publishes two prominent variants - android and jre. It is solved in probably the most elegant way possible with POM by encoding the variant name in the version number. Still this often causes issues as built tools do not know that the versions also present variants.
Each variant in GMM is identified by attributes. These attributes are used by Gradle to select the best fitting variant. Gradle defines a number of default attributes for JVM libraries. One of them is org.gradle.jvm.version. In the presented solution, we set the attribute to 6 for the android variants and to 8 for the jre variants. Gradle, knowing about the attribute, can now use that information. If you do in your build:
java.targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6

Gradle will automatically select android, if you set it to version 8 or higher, Gradle will select jre. If you set it to a lower version, Gradle will fail.
It does not matter if you depend on Guava directly or if it is brought in transitively. The central idea behind the variant-aware mechanism is that dependencies are defined between modules, but the variant selection is done when the dependencies are resolved based on the current context. For example, Gradle can say ""give me everything I need to compile this library for Java 6"" or ""give me everything I need to run this application with Java 9"".
Note: The presented solution keeps the way how Guava is publishing two ""versions"" at once. Only for Gradle now both versions are identical (both provide all variants). So in Gradle it would not matter if com.google.guava:guava:29.0-jre or com.google.guava:guava:29.0-android is in your dependency graph, as both provide the same variants. For Maven users, nothing changes as the poms are no different.
Compile-only API dependencies / annotation processor libraries on runtime classpath
Use case with description: guava-compile-only-dependencies
This addresses what is being discussed in #2824. With the solution presented here, you would get the following classpathes:
=== COMPILE ===
guava-28.1-jre.jar
failureaccess-1.0.1.jar
jsr305-3.0.2.jar
checker-qual-2.8.1.jar
error_prone_annotations-2.3.3.jar
j2objc-annotations-1.3.jar
=== RUNTIME ===
guava-28.1-jre.jar
failureaccess-1.0.1.jar
error_prone_annotations-2.3.3.jar

It can be discussed if that is what is desired, but the essential bit is that you can have things on the compile classpath but not on the runtime classpath (not possible with poms currently).
A component/variant can provide multiple capabilities
Use case 1: guava-listenablefuture-conflict
Use case 2: guava-vs-google-collections
Another concept introduced with variants is capabilities. A capability is essentially an identifier for a ""feature"" that is implemented by a component. This allows you to express that:

One component provides multiple features that you can individually use/depend on (in this case usually different variants of the component have different capabilities)
Two or more components provide the same capability and can not be selected together (this is the interesting case for Guava).

To be more concrete, each component has a default capability corresponding to its GAV coordinates:

com.google.guava:guava has the com.google.guava:guava capability
com.google.collections:google-collections has the com.google.collections:google-collections capability
com.google.guava:listenablefuture has the com.google.guava:listenablefuture capability

Now we can say that guava also has the com.google.collections:google-collections and com.google.guava:listenablefuture capabilities. Gradle will then not allow Guava together with these modules on the classpath and offers simple options to resolve the conflict. The 9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava workaround is then no longer needed to avoid undesired old versions of com.google.guava:listenablefuture on the classpath.
Note: since the pom is not changed, the workaround will stay in place for Maven.
How does publishing GMM work with Maven builds?
Usually, we would recommend using Gradle 6 as your build system if your library wants to publish individual variants or other GMM specifics, as it is not easy to manually set this up in a Maven build. However, the Guava build is already setup to do it - by combining two Maven builds. So everything is already in place, the only thing is that certain metadata information cannot be expressed/published in the poms.
As you can see in this PR, I added the .module file to the repo. (In Gradle, these files are generated during publishing as are the poms.) Since it mostly contains the additional information and Guava does not have many dependencies (and also does not want to add more), the file is of reasonable size to be maintained manually along the poms. Since the naming of the module file is following Maven conventions, it can be treated and published as an additional artifact by Maven - as you can see in this PR.
If you consider adopting this solution, I am happy to provide some kind of integration test (maybe based on the samples linked above) that validates that the module file is valid and that the information does not contradict the information in the pom files.
Further details
Sorry for this rather long text here. My goal is to illustrating the use cases and provide enough detail for a basic understanding of why we think many Gradle users would profit from having Guava publish Gradle Module Metadata. If you are interested in more details, here are a few links to sections in the Gradle user manual:

Gradle Module Metadata
Variant Selection
Variant Attributes
Capabilities
Enriching Guava's current metadata with a rule

We also recently did a Webinar on publishing that covers GMM:
https://gradle.com/blog/dependency-management-with-gradle-part-3-publishing-and-release-strategies/ (you can directly jump to 'Section 5 - Metadata' in the video)
And others have started to publish module files to central, so that is working :)
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/jupiter/junit-jupiter-api/5.6.0-M1/junit-jupiter-api-5.6.0-M1.module
I am happy to answer any questions on the topic and help working out a solution if there is interest in this on your side..kevinb9n: Thanks very much for this..jjohannes: We have published a blog post on the topic of how libraries can profit from Gradle Module Metadata and used Guava as an example: https://blog.gradle.org/guava
It basically covers what I have written in the PR description in better words. :)
While working on the post, I also wrote a Gradle plugin that adds the additional metadata to the existing Guava versions. So whoever is interested in trying this out today can use the plugin in a Gradle build: https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/de.jjohannes.missing-metadata-guava
(‚ö†Ô∏è If you publish a library, you should not use the plugin as all your consumers would have to apply it as well. That's why it would be great if we get this PR in for future Guava releases, because then the plugin is no longer needed)
@cgdecker As I got back to this topic, I thought about how we could add test coverage to this PR. I added an ""integration test"" that resolves the locally installed Guava SNAPSHOT version with Gradle and tests all different variations of classpathes. It tests against Gradle 5 (using POM metadata) and Gradle 6 (using GMM). This way, we make sure that both metadata files are in sync and that we only have the expected differences in the resolution result.
Since you don't have this kind tests (as far as I know), I added a script to run it: util/gradle_integration_tests.sh. It runs outside the Maven builds, as it requires both variants (JRE and Android) to be built first. Independent of the changes in this PR, such a test makes it easier for you to see the impact changes in dependencies have on Gradle users in general. This script can maybe be called as an additional step in the CI setup. Not sure if this is the best way to go. I am happy to rework this..cpovirk: Thanks again for this, and sorry that we have let it sit so long. I have a couple small questions, but we should probably err on the side of merging this soon, and we can always make changes later..jjohannes: Thanks for taking the time to get back to this @cpovirk.
I rebased this PR to latest master and addressed both of your comments. Please have a look.
From my perspective this can be merged as it is. The result of Gradle resolving a dependency to Guava is now pinned down in the integration test. That also tests the behaviour when resolving without Gradle Metadata. Which is a good addition to Guava's test coverage in general to make sure that changes to dependencies in pom files do not have unexpected side effects.
What remains to be done is to (automatically) execute the integration test by calling util/gradle_integration_tests.sh. I am not sure where to put this best. (Should it become part of the travis configuration?) This can be done as a follow up..cpovirk: Thank you again, this time for picking this up so quickly after our silence.
(Rewinding: I am going to ponder your earlier question about whether to move our annotation dependencies to compile-only scope. You can leave things as you have them, and I will tweak it if we want to be more conservative.)

I would assume Travis as well. A follow-up sounds perfectly fine..jjohannes: I went ahead and added the integration test as a step to travis to make sure it is working before we merge. Looks good as far a I can tell. At least it did run on this PR and passed.
Please feel free to merge. And do further changes later if required (I am happy to help, just ping me).
As a note regarding

(Rewinding: I am going to ponder your earlier question about whether to move our annotation dependencies to compile-only scope. You can leave things as you have them, and I will tweak it if we want to be more conservative.)

You are most likely aware: this is this long-standing feature request in Maven that was never picked up..cpovirk: Sorry, I have one more question, which I should have asked long ago. You said in your original message that Gradle will automatically choose guava-android if you set:
java.targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6

But... do Android users do this? It sounds like targetCompatibility corresponds to the javac -target argument, and I think that Android compiles normally set that to 8 (or maybe higher now?) so that they can use lambdas, etc. (which get desugared to work even without support in the Android runtime). But we still want those compiles to get the -android flavor of Guava. (That's both because most Android users don't want to assume that they can use Java 8 APIs and because our -android flavor contains some slightly different implementations that are optimized for Android considerations.)
Would we need to do something different in order to detect Android compiles (presumably by detecting something set by the Android Gradle Plugin)? [edit: I'm not clear on whether the following links are asking about something similar: https://discuss.gradle.org/t/how-to-detect-if-a-plugin-was-not-applied/28995,  https://stackoverflow.com/q/46204642/28465].cpovirk: (Maybe Android Gradle plugin should declare an attribute? I could try talking to that team if you think it would be helpful. Historically, we haven't been in touch with them a lot, but I'd like to think they'd be interested in this.).jjohannes: Android does not care about the jvm.version attribute at all. It only uses two attributes when resolving the classpath:

org.gradle.usage to distinguish between compile and runtime (this is the same as for Java)
com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr to distinguish between Android build types (release, debug, ...). Android libraries publish this attribute.

Unless I missed something, we'll have to use BuildTypeAttr here. But we don't want to set it to a specific value for the android variant, as any Android build type should get the android variant.
What we can do instead, is setting BuildTypeAttr on the jre variant to a value which is not one Android usually uses (for example to jre). Then the variant where the attribute is not set - android variant - will be preferred in Android projects.
In Java projects, the attribute is not used and is ignored.
While thinking about this, I also realised that we have to make sure that users can still make a different choice if, for some reason, they do not want to follow the recommended way:

In certain cases, I might still want to use the jre variant in Android projects
In certain cases, I might still want to use the android variant in Java projects, even if I target Java 8+

Such a selection is possible by setting attributes directly on the dependency (or a dependency constraint) to Guava. Which will either select the desired variant or, if there are other (transitive) dependencies to Guava, lead to a situation where both variants are selected. The latter case leads to a resolution error which you can resolve by adding a capability resolution. I added test cases for this to make sure it is actually working. The hope is that most users won't have to deal with this. But it needs to be possible to somehow ""opt-out"" of the default selection.
I pushed the proposed change and extended the integration test to also run against Android projects. I'll ask some colleagues and the Android Gradle plugin team about their thoughts on this..cpovirk: (RE: style guide: I'm not sure that our internal style guide, which requires 2-space indents, is actually available publicly -- just the Android one that requires 4-space indents :)).jjohannes: @cpovirk I talked to the Android Gradle Plugin team team and we think the BuildTypeAttr solution I provided right now is not very good. They are already looking into this use cases - a library having a JVM and Android variant - and they will probably make use of another attribute for it. We are discussing what the best solution here is.
I would suggest we hold off merging until that discussion resolved. I'll get back to you once this moved forward, in a few days..jjohannes: @cpovirk sorry it took us a bit. We have discussed this topic at Gradle and with the Android Gradle Plugin team. We agreed that there is a general use case interesting for many library authors and that we need a new JVM ecosystem specific standard attribute that Gradle and AGP recognise. Here is a proposal for that. And a spike implementation demonstrating how it would work.
As soon as there is agreement, this will be added and I'll update this PR once we have a nightly build that supports it..cpovirk: Sorry for my silence on this. I still intend to get back to it, but it may take a while..jjohannes: We finally made progress on adding support for a new attribute - org.gradle.jvm.environment - to address the use cases discussed above. Gradle 7.0+ and AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) 7.0.0+ will support this out-of-the box.
Gradle Issue: gradle/gradle#15430
AGP Issue: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/179488433
The current status is that Gradle 7.0-milestone-2 already includes it.
For AGP 7.0.0, it is planned to be added in one of the next alpha or beta releases.
I updated this PR to reflect this and updated the test to validate that this actually works. I added a piece of script code that adds the piece still missing in AGP:
1b22705#diff-6123082126ba075c26196209a0c54ee00c640049ca630de4f9ae2aeb7f809629R49-R55
This should be removed once we have a AGP release with the feature. Then this is good to go from our side.

"Remove @Beta: Immutable{BiMap,List,Map,Set}.builderWithExpectedSize",P3 cla: yes package=collect type=debeta,,,"michaelxinsun: Previously, I modified Dagger so that its generated code is using
builderWithExpectedSize for immutable collections whenever it's
available, i.e., Guava 23.1 or later:
google/dagger#1094
Since builderWithExpectedSize is a @beta API, if a Bazel client
project depends on Dagger, and if the depended Dagger is using
Guava 23.1 or later, Dagger generates code that uses this Guava
@beta API, which fails ErrorProne, thus failing Bazel build:
google/dagger#1569
The same issue could also happen if a Maven client project has a
maven-compiler-plugin that also uses ErrorProne.
If the Guava team feel confident about those
builderWithExpectedSize static factory methods, maybe it's time
to remove @Beta for them altogether.

We do not know if there was an exception or not. There is currently no difference between an exception thrown by the measured code block and an exception being returned by the same code block.
I don't know what the people would prefer: let the exception pass through and get no result of a timed stopwatch, or on the contrary measure the code block and get the caught exception in a specific returned value.
So I'd say this would require more API:

measure -> Duration (ignore result, and let the exception through)
measureAndGet -> TimedResult (get the result, but let the exception through)
measureAndCatch? -> ExceptionallyTimedResult? (get the result, catch the exception, measure anyways)

The objective of this PR is to avoid unnecessary allocation of memory to create transfer-buffers to e.g. move data from an InputStream to an OutputStream by introducing a package-local class TransferBuffer to the com.google.io package.
There had been a similar PR from me before, this is a complete rewrite based on the original idea. This is a purely internal optimization that does not change any public API.

CopyToBenchmark#testCopy() runs 10000 ByteStreams#copyto(inputStream, outputStream)-methods sequentially in a single thread. The first image is the profile on the master-branch, the second on the transfer_buffer_optimization-branch. Memory consumption and gc-activity are both multiple times lower on with transfer-buffer reuse.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..berndhopp: I pushed some small typo- and formatting fixes in TransferBuffer.java in commits I squashed into the original commit, so the git history looks cleaner.cgdecker: This general idea has come up before, and while it looks good on paper (and in terms of the runtime numbers you've provided) I have a number of concerns with it:

I feel like holding onto 8k of memory indefinitely is a very unexpected side-effect of a static method, especially since it gives the user no control over that.
Soft references are nice in theory but not great in practice. Again, I don't like the idea of using them without the user having any control over their use.

Basically, while this certainly looks like a win in terms of JVM runtime numbers, it makes tradeoffs that have unclear costs. The current implementation is at least clear in that it doesn't hold onto extra memory period.
A related idea I've had is creating some class with instance methods for I/O methods like these, which wraps something the user has full control over like a buffer pool. But it's not something I've had a lot of time to think about and is obviously more difficult to use unless you're using dependency injection.
Anyway, I'll try to give this some more thought..berndhopp: @cgdecker any news here?.berndhopp: @cgdecker  any news here?",2019-07-09T09:40:10Z,None,3,0,5

RFC: Optimize AbstractFuture.setFuture,P3 cla: yes package=concurrent status=triaged type=performance,cpovirk,,"njhill: Chained/recursive async ListenableFuture transformations (e.g. via Futures.transformAsync/catchingAsync/scheduleAsync/... or SettableFuture.setFuture) currently cause indefinite growth of live objects, with intermediate futures not eligible for collection until the entire chain/tree is completed, even if/when already set asynchronously. This PR is a proof-of-concept experiment to rework the setFuture mechanics so that such chains are collapsed on the fly where possible, and makes some related optimizations along the way. It needs some further refinement but should be fully functional.
High-level overview
The approach is motivated by the observation that chains (or more generally trees) of AbstractFutures, previously linked via setFuture calls, form a disjoint group whose members share a common fate. Although a tree structure is implied by the order in which the futures were combined, only identification of the root has any significance w.r.t. future program state. In other words the group can be considered as a set with no structure apart from the existence of a unique ""unset"" member. And since listeners and waiters added to any of the futures in the group are interested only in the common outcome, there's no need for them to remain tied to their ""local"" future instance.
If the future overrides afterDone() then it must remain reachable, i.e. there is no hope of unpinning it. Unfortunately this applies to most of the internal AbstractFuture subclasses used to implement the Futures methods, but it turns out they can be refactored to use a (newly introduced) weaker hook named afterEarlyCancellation(). This gets called if and only if the future is cancelled prior to being set asynchronously.
AbstractFutures which make use of setFuture() but don't override afterDone() are considered to be ""passively completable"" - they can be manipulated such that from the outside they appear to behave/complete as normal, but no callback references need to be retained to them once they are set asynchronously. This is achieved by relocating/redirecting their Listeners and Waiters elsewhere.
Passive completability is currently signalled by overriding a new protected requiresAfterDoneCallback() method to return false (it returns true by default). There may be a better approach like a marker interface or new abstract AbstractFuture subclass or even automatic determination via reflection, though the cost of the latter may be prohibitive.
Internal changes
The private SetFuture class currently serves as an immutable link to the next future, pointing to both the source and target, and is also registered as a listener on the target. This has been changed to serve a different purpose, now a mutable, shared placeholder set as the value for multiple AbstractFutures belonging to the same async-set group. It still has two fields - a fixed (final) pointer to an arbitrary ""delegate"" member of the group (chosen when first established), and a volatile pointer to the group's current unset future*.
A new future ""joins"" the group when an existing member is successfully passed to its setFuture method or is passed itself as the argument to the setFuture method of the group's current unset target. In either case the group's existing SetFuture instance becomes the value of the newly joined AbstractFuture. If the new future is passively completable, its listener stack is moved to the group's delegate future (replaced by a new MOVED Listener sentinel), which is guaranteed to be explicitly completed. Waiters in this scenario are released, will recheck their owning future's value finding it is now a SetFuture, and then just block on SF.delegate.get().
A new private Pending class represents the same unset state as null but is set as the value of the group's single unset (innermost) member and holds a pointer to that group's SetFuture object. When setFuture is called on this unset future the Pending value is unwrapped, replaced with the SetFuture object it contains. If trusted, the new future's value is set to the same Pending object (it moves down the chain). The whole operation involves no new allocation if the futures are passively completable.
A listener is typically no longer created when passively completable futures are set asynchronously, however the design requires that the assigned ""delegate"" future for the group is explicitly completed whether or not it is passively completable. This is easily arranged since when the innermost future is finally (non-asynchronously) set, this delegate can be found immediately via the Pending object which the terminal value replaces. If the innermost future is async-set to a non-trusted future, the Pending object is discarded and the contained SetFuture is added as a listener to the target (it continues to implement Runnable for this reason).
Before:

After:

Completion ""callbacks"" are still required for non-passively completable async-set futures (apart from those which happen to be a SetFuture delegate). A new private Completer class is used for this purpose - a simple Runnable pointing back to the future in question.
As well as benefiting allocations and object retention, this approach reduces the total number of volatile writes and CAS operations required to process a given chain of futures.
(*) For clarity the above explanation ignores the special case of joining two existing async-set groups that occurs if the unset member of a non-singleton async-set group is set to a future already belonging to a different (necessarily disjoint) non-singleton async-set group. Logically the outcome is just a single async-set group formed by their union, whose unset member is that of the second one. But special handling is required in the implementation since we now have two SetFutures, neither of which can be discarded: one of them is ""retired"" and added as a listener to the other, which means that its target value will no longer be updated when the aggregate async-set group's target changes. However the future which the target is set to will either be updated or (if there are futher group compositions) lead transitively via a chain of SetFutures to one which is updated. Thus the new impl can still result in chains of async futures but they should be much rarer and shorter, since each link in such a chain must have resulted from a setFuture composition of non-singleton async-set groups of futures.
Futures.addCallback()
A small modification is also included to avoid listeners added via Futures.addCallback() continuing to hold a ref to their target future once it has been async-set - the Futures$CallbackListener.future field is changed to be non-final (safe since it's published via CAS to the listeners stack), and is updated to the group's delegate future at the time the listener is redirected or relocated by AbstractFuture.
Results
The following exaggerated example takes more than 2 minutes to fail with an OutOfMemoryError after ~14 million iterations when run with the current version and -Xms1g -Xmx1g. With this PR and -Xms32m -Xmx32m it completes 100 million iterations successfully in less than 4 seconds:
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int reps = 100_000_000;
  SettableFuture<String> orig = SettableFuture.create(), prev = orig;
  for (int i = 0; i < reps; i++) {
    SettableFuture<String> curr = SettableFuture.create();
    prev.setFuture(curr);
    prev = curr;
  }
  prev.set(""done""); // prev represents the 'innermost' future
  assert orig.isDone();
}
There is negligible if any change to the existing caliper benchmark numbers (both runtime and allocations), but a new benchmark for testing performance of setFuture and subsequent completion based on the above snippet shows considerable improvement:

Behaviour differences

Cancellation of async-set groups of futures is less racy / more consistent, with a guarantee that either all or none of them will be cancelled. This ensures above assertions about shared fate hold true, which isn't technically the case in the current impl since cancellation completions propagate along chains in one direction and all other kinds of completion in the other.
toString() output no longer includes intermediate async-set futures. A justification could be that the omitted information is merely ""historical"" and doesn't pertain to the future's current state or later outcome.
Cancel-with-interruption semantics while still ""consistent"" differ a bit from the current rules. A simple way to describe the new behaviour is to say that asynchronously-set futures cannot themselves be interrupted. Calling cancel(true) on them will still cancel the future(s) to which their fate is now bound (and any whose fate depends on them), but only the innermost (unset) future will have its wasInterrupted flag set and interruptTask() method invoked (if it's an AbstractFuture). This behaviour aligns nicely with the existing Futures internal impls and feels reasonable given that it arguably doesn't make sense to ""interrupt"" a future which is already set asynchronously since it's now essentially acting as a proxy for the future it was async-set to. It's also the case that although now corrected to be consistent, the current interruption handling is necessarily somewhat arbitrary because there's no way to determine the interrupted state of a third-party cancelled future. Java's CompletableFutures ignore mayInterruptIfRunning entirely.

Further simplifications considered

Initialize the internal value field to UNSET, defined as a static constant new Pending(null) and have null represent itself. This elminiates the NULL constant and simplifies various logic (checking for unset can be just value instanceof Pending rather than value == null | value instanceof Pending), but negatively impacted construction speed, at least on x86_64 linux as measured by the caliper benchmarks.
Replace the SetFuture class by the delegate future itself, with the delegate's value set to the group's current target ListenableFuture. Use a simple wrapper to differentiate terminal values which are ListenableFutures themselves (assumed to be less common). This turned out to also negatively impact general performance due to the fact that instanceof SomeInterfaceWithManyImpls (e.g. ListenableFuture) is greater than an order of magitude more expensive than instanceof SomeFinalClass (e.g. SetFuture).
Instead of the new afterEarlyCancellation hook, add one called afterSet which is called once, after the future is first set (either finally or async). This seems clearer/cleaner API-wise but at least in the case of the internal futures impls, some of the required logic is specific to the early cancellation case (for example this is the only one requiring possible propagation to the delegate) so fewer conditional checks end up being needed.

I have not tried this yet but expect further optimization is possible to Listener handling, in particular changing Listener to an interface or abstract class which the ""internal"" callbacks can extend directly to eliminate some allocation and indirection, and bypass the public addListener method when moving listeners between TrustedFutures..njhill: @cpovirk any thoughts on the value of this kind of change?

Thing that confused me the most that such functionality has been rejected for Apache Commons (Collections) long time ago and has not been reviewed.

Huh, that's interesting. Could you point us towards a web page or something that confirms this, e.g. an entry in the Apache Commons mailing list?

I hope that Guava community does not think the same way.

In a way, I hope so too! But I'm not a Googler, and even though a community of sorts has developed around Guava over the years, it's still the Guava team over at Google who have the ultimate say over what goes in and what doesn't. And the Guava team (1) have very high standards and (2) have historically not been the best at responding to issues and PRs quickly.
So to give you a realistic idea of what to expect:

I'd say that you should expect to wait a few months or so before someone on the team does respond.
When they do respond, expect that they will want to follow their thorough internal review process first and design the API themselves to meet their own standards, at which point they'll probably do the implementation as well since that's the easy part. :).dgray16: @jbduncan
Hi there.
Appriciate your advices : )
Apache:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-541
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-156.jbduncan: You're welcome @dgray16! And thank you very much for providing the links. üëç.jbduncan: Ah okay, I see that https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-541 is still open, actually, but that it's just not been at the top of anyone's priority list at Apache Commons.
I see that PR apache/commons-collections#5 was opened to implement that issue, but it was closed and I do not (yet?) understand why.
I see that this Apache Commons JIRA comment raises a concern over the method using a new Random() internally (which the code in this PR also suffers from). This is a problem because it means that one can't use an external Random with a deterministic ""seed"". Being able to set the ""seed"" for a Random is rather important in tests, since otherwise not the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers would get generated each time the Random's methods are called in the tests, meaning that test results would be hard to reproduce.
There's also the problem that users may want to use pseudo-random number generators other than Random, e.g. SecureRandom or Apache Commons RNG's implementations. Thus to accomodate these, Iterables.getRandom(Iterable) would really need to be something like Iterable.getRandom(Iterable, IntSupplier).
But I'm sure that when the Guava team gets around to this, they'll cover these details if they think the idea behind this PR is a good idea. So no need to worry about them yet. :).dgray16: @jbduncan
I think that approach with IntSupplier is good one, but do not you think that in this way we are trying to solve the problem that does not exist?
Like, I am typical user of this API, and I want to get the result in the easiest way.
I will repeat myself once more that I am not against additional overloaded methods, I want to define motivation of potential API user..jbduncan: @dgray16 Good question! I've only just started working as a grad software engineer, so I don't have loads of experience yet, so for all I know, maybe going for a solution like using IntSupplier is indeed trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist!
All I can say is it's my gut feeling that to not include such an overload will be questioned by people eventually, especially if this JEP is ever accepted, which aims to introduce more pseudo-random number generators in the Java standard library and provide common interfaces for them.
Guava team, WDYT?.JakeWharton: You can do this with streams by skipping a random amount and invoking findFirst()..jrtom: Here are some issues that I'd expect to come up in the API review.  (@jbduncan has already pointed out some of the key ones; thanks for that!)
First of all, this is what you're proposing as the implementation, which seems reasonable for what it's doing:
Iterables.get(iterable, new Random().nextInt(Iterables.size(iterable)))

Let's consider the primary metric by which Guava evaluates possible API additions.
Utility: your proposal would replace the above one-liner by a shorter one-liner that is (in my opinion) not difficult to do correctly, or to read.  So the utility--the amount of added value--is fairly low.
Ubiquity: generally we try to approximate that by looking for the number of times that the replaced code is used inside Google (since that's where we can easily search, and it's a pretty big code base).
Doing a search on Iterables.get\(.*new\sRandom reveals that this pattern is currently used fewer than 10 times inside Google, so the 'ubiquity' aspect isn't looking great.
One thing that I think is a minus to this proposal: it hides the call to Iterables.size().  This is fine if you're supplying a Collection, but if you're supplying an Iterable that isn't one, every time you call this method you re-incur the cost of calculating the size.
When combined with @jbduncan's good points--that you would want to be able to provide both the RNG and the seed, thus increasing the surface area of this API--this suggests to me that this proposal is unlikely to be accepted..dgray16: @JakeWharton
Thanks for suggestion.
Do not you think that it would be more efficient to get element from array by index instead of iterating through list in case of List?
With iterator we forced to iterate anyway.
And by the way java.util.stream.Stream#findAny() works a bit ""unrandom""..dgray16: @jrtom
Thanks for reply.

Poor implemetation was made because of my confidence of a fact that such a ""toy""method should not be too complex in its implementation.
Performance issue: this is kind of eternal debate : ) I think that hardware in 2018 is powerful enough to handle task to find size even for 10k elements in iterable.

Anyway it is just a discussion, my point is to present idea rather then argue about it..Maaartinus: Doing a search on Iterables.get\(.*new\sRandom reveals that this pattern is currently used fewer than 10 times inside Google, so the 'ubiquity' aspect isn't looking great.

@jrtom That's maybe 10 times too much. AFAIK the recommended way is to use ThreadLocalRandom.current().....

Poor implemetation was made because of my confidence of a fact that such a ""toy""method should not be too complex in its implementation.

@dgray16 Actually, everything in a widely used library should be as close to perfect as possible since it may get used a lot.
Your implementation is not bad. It's about the best solution for most cases, but sometimes, a different implementation may be needed:

The iterable may be obtained from a concurrent structure and it may shrink after size() was called and the call to Iterables.get may throw.
Sometimes, the iteration may be so slow, that copying all elements to an array may be preferable to iterating twice.

Because of that, I prefer to have no utility method, as writing my own code makes me think about such cases..ogregoire: This looks like a duplicate of #2041 ..jrtom: @ogregoire You could think of this as being a special case of #2041, but since selection using a uniform random distribution is such a common thing to want to do (that, importantly, requires considerably less specification than any non-uniform distribution) I think it's reasonable to treat them as mostly-separate problems, while recognizing that they're related and that a solution for one should be reasonably congruent to the other..kashike: A version of this that accepts a Random would be nice too..kluever: @jrtom I found 26 hits inside google using ""Iterables.get(.*random"", which is more than you, but still fairly low on the ubiquity scale.
I'm also generally -1 on this proposal (all of the above comments are good), but I'm happy to leave this open in the ""research"" category in case other folks want to make a stronger case for it.
In the case that you have a List (which I suspect is the majority case), we're not actually saving much:
list.get(random.nextInt(list.size()); // before
Iterables.getRandom(list, random); // after
If you have an Iterable/Collection, sure it's a little longer, but still not that much of a savings:
Iterables.get(iterable, random.nextInt(Iterables.size(iterable))); // before
Iterables.getRandom(iterable, random); // after",2018-09-16T09:57:00Z,None,1,2,11

So if they take forever to respond (which seems likely at this stage, sadly), it absolutely won't be because you did something wrong; they're just apparently very, very busy with their day-to-day jobs, and someone from the team will eventually respond to this PR.
If you don't get a response as quickly as you'd like, writing a reminder message like the one you wrote here every now and then should encourage a more timely response, even if they're a bit too busy to review the PR properly.

FYI, I do see a pretty significant amount of Google code writing stuff like if (s.toLowerCase().startsWith(...)) so I do think the case for adding these methods to Guava may be a pretty good one..martinfrancois: @kevinb9n thanks for the update on this! It has now been almost half a year, are there any internal processes it still needs to go through or did the team just not get around to merging it into the codebase yet?
Thanks!.cgdecker: I want to quickly note here that when an issue or PR is marked ""triaged"" and assigned to someone, that doesn't necessarily mean it's accepted. Triaged just means that someone has looked at it and thinks it's well-formed and worth thinking about more, and assigned it to someone who they think should best be able to consider it. That said, Kevin has noted that this seems like something that there's a good chance we'll want to do.
Another note: API additions do generally need to go through an API review process we have internally, which tends to involve writing up a doc exploring pros and cons of an API, basic statistics for how often existing code in our codebase would want to use the API(s), options for how to address the problem, etc., followed by scheduling it to be discussed with a group of reviewers. That's obviously a bit of work, so even when you've written the code, it can be hard to fit it in with everything else we're doing. That's not to say we can't do better--we can and should do better, and are working on improving our processes around bugs/PRs--but just to give some idea of why things might take so long sometimes..martinfrancois: Thanks a lot @cgdecker! I tried to find a description of your process but was unable to. Your description made it very clear to me.

Changed the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to StringIndexOutOfBoundsException,P4 cla: yes package=base status=triaged type=enhancement,,kevinb9n,"muteness: In the repeat method of Strings class, if the length of the potential output string overflows, the exception to be thrown should be StringIndexOutOfBoundsException instead of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException..kevinb9n: We will think about changing this; however I don't think this is the right exception type either. It's not a matter of an index that was greater than the size of an array OR a string..cpovirk: We have precedent for throwing OutOfMemoryError in Files. But then we'd also commented that we wanted to use it in CharEscaper/UnicodeEscaper but that we couldn't because it's not available under GWT :\.muteness: I thought it'd be better to have a custom exception for this, but one of the constructors in the String class  (public String(char value[], int offset, int count)) throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when count is negative or offset > value.length - count..cpovirk: I guess the closest precedent is StringBuilder, which also throws OutOfMemoryError (though again, not under GWT)..muteness: I just looked into the StringBuilder implementation. I think it throws OutOfMemoryError when it cannot allocate a capacity for the underlying array.
But for the same purpose as the repeat method, it throws StringIndexOutOfBoundException.
Take the following method as an example.
If str.length() + count overflows, it doesn't throw OutOfMemoryError but instead throws StringIndexOutOfBoundException from getChars method.
public AbstractStringBuilder append(String str) {
    if (str == null)
        return appendNull();

                newCapacity(minimumCapacity));

Implementation of #2113 (random string generation API),P3 cla: yes type=addition,HaasJona,,"ogregoire: This is a standard and clean implementation for a random string generation API.
RandomStringGenerator generator = new RandomStringGenerator.Builder()
  .withLowercaseAsciiLetters()
  .withAsciiDigits(1)
  .withCharacters(""!@#"")
  .build(10);
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  String generated = generator.next();
  // generated is guaranteed to have 10 characters of which at least one digit
}

There are a few choice that guided my implementation:

It must implement Supplier.
The configuration must be in the builder to allow a clean and simple generator API. The builder is necessary -- instead of a Splitter-like or CharMatcher-like API -- because we don't know which characters to provide by default and providing those methods as starting points make it overly complex.
A custom Random had to be providable.
The implementation had to be thread-safe.
I discarded the idea of a variable length String generator because that would have been very difficult to implement (several classes/subclasses of Generator), and is overkill. People usually want to generate Strings of the same length. If not, one can still keep the Builder and create several generators.
There had to be a ""similar characters"" discarder to avoid 1 to be confused with l, for instance.
""aaab"" would have to give 3 times more a than b by default, and a method had to exist to leave the possibility to give each char the same weight.

I feel like this implementation is much cleaner than #2682 which had a lot of design issues and doesn't help in any case the String generation, because all the parameters had to be kept by the user, where this implementation relieves him from that burden.",2017-01-10T01:55:18Z,None,1,0,4

Improved the performance of indexOf methods of primitives,P4 cla: yes package=primitives type=performance,,,"liach: Improved the performance of indexOf methods of primitives.
The original time efficiency was O(nm), where n is the size of the array
and m is the size of target. The new time efficiency is O(n).
The algorithm used is Sunday algorithm, a string matching algorithm that can be used on arrays.
All tests passed locally..lowasser: Though it has a better worst case, it's not clear to me that this is actually likely to be a win in practice.  For example, Java's built-in String.indexOf has long stuck to an O(mn) algorithm just because its constant factors in practice tend to be so dramatically better.  How much does this change affect the constant factor of the ""good"" case, as opposed to the worst case?.liach: For now I do not really have good data to test these methods. Could you provide some big data if possible?.jbduncan: Hi @liach. From what I can tell, I'm not sure if you actually need big data to test the performance of your new implementations of the methods.
In situations like this, people typically write micro-benchmarks with a framework like JMH to show how their solutions compare to existing ones speed-wise.
So my personal suggestion would be to investigate JMH if you're not already familiar with it, and then write a micro-benchmark between the current impls and yours, show us the results, and provide us with the source code so we can help you improve the benchmark in case it doesn't follow best practices. (But I admit that I wouldn't be the best person to ask about best practices, as I hardly know how to even write benchmarks with JMH or other frameworks.)
(I know that Google use Caliper instead as their framework for micro-benchmarking, but some people think it's a bit flawed and that JMH produces more accurate results, so I'd personally be inclined to use JMH for my own benchmarks. But that's a story for another time and for someone else to talk about, as I am not familiar with the details. üòÑ).liach: Actually are benchmarks like these?.jbduncan: Yes, that's right. What you've shown is a link to one of Guava's Caliper benchmarks. However, I'd strongly recommend looking into OpenJDK JMH instead, because it's supposed to be much more reliable.
By my understanding, one of the reasons for this is that for loops are easy for the Oracle Hotspot JVM (and presumably other JVMs) to optimise away in non-obvious situations, and Caliper encourages its users to use for loops to benchmark code many times (this is done differently in JMH, which uses annotations and special optimization-defeating trickery instead), so Caliper benchmarks are more likely to report incorrect timings and thus are less reliable.
See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mechanical-sympathy/m4opvy4xq3U/7lY8x8SvHgwJ for more information..liach: Do I do in a separate project? I am not really clear about this..jbduncan: I think so? That's what the front page seems to say. But I'm really not the right person to ask, as I've never written a benchmark before.",2016-11-08T21:54:58Z,None,2,9,5

Add Splitter methods to return CharSequence types.,P4 cla: yes type=enhancement,,,"mspiegel: Not sure if this has been discussed previously but it is trivial to add methods that return CharSequence types to the Splitter API and maintain the existing API. We have some use cases for this feature where we do not want to create temporary char[] array copies of the intermediate substrings.
The Splitter API accepts CharSequence types as input and internally manipulates CharSequence types. This patch maintains the existing methods that return String types and adds additional methods that
return CharSequence types. The performance overhead on the existing methods that return String type is one additional call to Iterators#transform() that calls toString() on the CharSequence results.

JVM did not allocate new char[] arrays for subsequences. That behavior was
changed in their release of JDK 7u6:

need for new methods that do not create new char[] arrays?

#2210 (comment)..cpovirk: We may end up doing this. The reasons that I haven't just merged it are:

Our theory is that few operations are (a) slow and yet (b) unable to fail. Most are either predictably fast (in which case you don't need the timeout) or able to fail (in which case you need the checked exception -- say, for an RPC).
Users who do have slow yet unable to fail operations may be better served by the full ForkJoin framework, which... hmm, I thought that it provided timed gets, but it seems not, at least not on ForkJoinTask? Maybe it's defined somewhere else?
In most cases, it's hard to see a timeout as a ""programming error."" (Now, we do already have UncheckedTimeoutException for TimeLimiter, as you've noted... but that's an API that we've felt kind of icky about since we created it.)
It's not 100% clear what to do with interruption. I think that what you do is probably right. But if the wait is expected to sometimes be long, then waiting uninterruptibly may not be ideal for all users.
I have some general regret around the getChecked/getUnchecked family of methods. This comes mainly from the fact that getChecked is poorly suited for Android: It's likely to be slow (especially in the failure case but even somewhat slow in the success case on old versions), and more importantly, it doesn't play nice with Proguard. But how does that tie in to getUnchecked? Well, if people can't use getChecked, they're going to be tempted to use getUnchecked, even if it's not the right thing for them. So there's a part of me that wishes that we hadn't added either method.

Again, we still might do this. It just requires some weighing of pros and cons. Having the code waiting for us is nice, at least :)",2015-10-27T18:59:18Z,None,4,3,4

Note that Java 8 added some unsigned type support, so I'm not sure we want to further expand Guava in this area..travisdowns: FWIW this would be very useful. Java 8 offers limited support for unsigned types, and in particular it does not offer UnsignedShorts.checkedCast() (it only offers widening conversions). That happens to be my use case..cowwoc: @lowasser Any outstanding issues preventing this addition?",2015-07-08T06:57:35Z,None,1,0,7
Iterables.get() alternative returning Optional.absent(),P3 cla: yes type=enhancement,,,"gotenxds: Hi, decided it will be nice to have an Optional version to the get methods of Iterables.
Also as suggested here #1742 but with a minor difference:
Both methods will return Optional.absent if the position is grater then the requested index and will also return Optional.absent if the value in the requested index is null.

If you signed the CLA as a corporation, please let us know the company's name..gotenxds: I signed it..googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!.lowasser: This looks like you could easily do it yourself as Optional.fromNullable(Iterables.get(Iterable, into, null)).  Is it worth adding another method when it's that easy to roll yourself?.gotenxds: Sure you could do
Optional.fromNullable(Iterables.get(iterable, index, null));
But I think it's quite a mouthful, plus there is that null where the default value is which is not a big deal when you use the
optionalGet(list , 4, myDeafultValue)
But it reduces readability when all you need is
optionalGet(list , 4)
Debugging a code with this line
Optional.fromNullable(Iterables.get(iterable, index, null));
Will make you enter iterables.get implementation to understand the null value..Loki-Afro: üëç I agree with gotenxds..drothmaler: I like the idea, but i propose to change the name to tryGet, because it aligns better with find/tryFind and as a bonus it's even shorter :-)",2015-04-07T06:34:09Z,None,2,0,6
Add callbacks to EventBus,P4 cla: yes package=eventbus type=addition,,,"smetarom: I would appreciate a feature, where I can  add additional functionality to EventBus. My main goal is to extend logging and debugging capabilities of EventBus.
My proposal is to create callbacks, which are overwritten in the child class. As at is now, I have to do logging before I call EventBus.post and it creates code duplication.
The simple example:
EventBus eventBus = new EventBus() {
@override
protected void onEventPosted(Object event) {
// do some logging
}
};
I added onRegister, onUnregister, onEventPosted, and onNoSubscriberRegistered callbacks to corresponding methods.",2015-03-17T07:12:50Z,None,1,1,3

 Log a warning if running under a Java 7 VM.
More precisely, log a warning if lambda expressions or type annotations in our classes would produce an exception. If someone wants to use Retrolambda or a similar tool to rewrite our classes, that's fine with us if it works. And our support for Android is unchanged: The Android toolchain rewrites lambdas and removes type annotations.
This is a step toward removing Java 7 support entirely: #5269
RELNOTES=Introduced a warning log message when running under Java 7. This warning is not guaranteed to be logged when running under Java 7, so please don't rely on it as your only warning about future problems. If the warning itself causes you trouble, you can eliminate it by silencing the logger for com.google.common.base.MoreObjects$ToStringHelper (which is used only for this warning). This warning prepares for removing support for Java 7 in 2021. Please report any problems.

#3945 - Fixed parent.relativePath issue in guava-bom,P2 cla: yes type=defect,,netdpb,abchaubey: Fixed : #3945,2020-12-05T19:19:26Z,2020-12-10T15:48:59Z,1,0,2
Fix compatibility between the cache compute methods and a load,P2 cla: yes package=cache type=defect,"lowasser,netdpb",netdpb,"ben-manes: The asMap().compute implementation did not take into account that the present value may be loading. A load does not block other writes to that entry and takes into account that it may be clobbered, causing it to automatically discard itself. This is a known design choice that breaks linearizability assumptions (#1881). The compute should check if a load is in progress and call the appropriate internal removal method.
Because a zombie entry remained in the cache and still is marked as loading, the loader could discover entry and try to wait for it to materialize. When the computation is a removal, indicated by a null value, the loader would see this as the zombie's result. Since a cache loader may not return null it would throw an exception to indicate a user bug.
A new ComputingValueReference resolves both issues by indicating that the load has completed. The compute's removeEntry will then actually remove this entry and the loader will not wait on the zombie. Instead if it observes the entry, it will neither receive a non-null value or wait for it to load, but rather try to load anew under the lock. This piggybacks on the reference collection support where an entry is present but its value was garbage collected, causing the load to proceed. By the time the lock is obtained the compute method's entry was removed and the load proceeds as normal (so no unnecessary notification is produced).

My motivation was that it's slightly easier for a nullness checker to determine that System.getProperty(standardProperty) is (generally speaking) non-null. But it turns out that java.runtime.name is not a standard property!
Still, this is a slight simplification, so I guess I'm submitting.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..melloware: @googlebot I signed it!.jbduncan: As an external user of Guava (not part of the team), this looks good to me. üëç.cpovirk: Thanks. We're hoping that we'll be able to merge this. That said, we won't be able to make the change in our Android versions (since they target a version of Android without java.nio.file). So I hope that Sonatype and Snyk will be able to configure their tools to recognize that 35.0-jre, etc. are safe even when they consider 35.0-android, etc. to be vulnerable..melloware: @cpovirk Yes I did not touch the Android version on purpose in this PR and I can speak for Sonatype it does know the -jre version of the JAR in its detection methods so it will be able to mark this resolved for Guava 31.0-jre if that is the version it ends up in!.cpovirk: Oh, great, thank you. I was worried that they might depend on being able to specify the vulnerable versions as Maven ranges. But if they can say ""all -android versions are vulnerable"" (or just list all the existing ones individually, or maybe even preemptively list likely future versions), then that should do the trick..cgdecker: My current inclination is that we should not make this change.
This change is a behavioral change that has the potential to break existing users if they're intentionally accessing temp directories created with the method from a separate process (communicating the path to another process via some means, say). My expectation is that 99%+ of users are just using temp dirs from the process that creates them, but I don't feel like I can rule out the possibility of this breaking someone.
That wouldn't necessarily be reason enough not to do this, except that I think the current state of things is not that bad. The method is deprecated and has a clear and easy replacement for most users. Given that, I'd want to feel certain that we wouldn't be breaking anyone in order for this change to feel worthwhile..melloware: @cgdecker the fact that its still marked Beta means users should not expect it not to change between versions if they are expecting some legacy behavior they can update their code not to use this deprecated method.
IMHO the Security risk alone warrants this change for all the reasons I stated both in the ticket and above.  Just my two cents..cpovirk: A couple other observations from some quick internal testing:


This fails at least one internal test. That test sets java.io.tmpdir to /invalid and then expect the createTempDir call to fail. That said, I doubt that any actual production code cares about that behavior. Rather, the test was probably just verifying that the correct type of exception was thrown if the operation did fail. Still, it's possible that there's a behavior change here. I didn't look into whether java.nio.file was creating the missing /invalid parent directory (probably unlikely, since I doubt it has permissions?) or failing to respect the programmatic change to java.io.tmpdir. If the latter, someone might care.


This breaks some of our J2ObjC users. That said, I was able to mark the method as @J2ObjcIncompatible, and tests passed again. In theory, if a J2ObjC user were using createTempDir, this would be a breaking change. But that may well never come up.


Still, the points stand that this is @Beta and @Deprecated.
It's hard to know what would be least disruptive to users :(.JLLeitschuh: CC. So you can update the Syky advisory

Benji @benjifin
Leeya @leeyashalti.melloware: @cpovirk When it comes to security, disruption should be least of concerns.  See SolarWinds hack 2020....cpovirk: To try to merge the various discussions about this security vulnerability as a whole into one place, I'm closing this in favor of the discussion on #4011 (comment). As noted above and in that thread, this PR solves the problem only for the -jre variant, and we expect to solve the problem for both variants by removing the method entirely..melloware: Awesome lets remove it!",2020-11-19T20:29:02Z,2021-01-29T18:36:23Z,1,1,5

 Add AndroidAccessToCollectors.
This adds the base Immutable collectors already in CollectCollectors, but is still lacking the Table-collections, Multi-collections, and mutable-collections.

 Backport ImmutableTable.combine
That should be the last combine to backport. All remainging collectors are implemented in terms of existing collection transformations.

 Backport `combine` to java7 for `ImmutableMap`.
This is so that Java8 code relying on the Java7 branch of Guava can still efficiently collect Guava collections.
The Java8/Java7 implementations branched once again, where Java8 uses an array of Entries, whereas Java7 uses an array of alternating key/value pairs. Either way, the implementations were pretty trivial this time.

 Backport combine to java7 for `ImmutableRangeSet`/`ImmutableRangeSet`.
This is so that Java8 code relying on the Java7 branch of Guava can still efficiently collect Guava collections.
I saved this for last, but they turned out to be the easiest to do. Tests are kind of crap, but honestly, baseline tests also seemed a little bit light to me.

 Fix documentation for HashCode.toString() that incorrectly claimed it returned in big-endian order.
The implementation of toString() goes through the bytes in the same order that asBytes() returns, so if the order of the underlying bytes is little-endian (as is the case for LongHashCode), then the string will also be little-endian, contradicting what the documentation says.

Prior to this change, custom runners could make FrameworkMethod instances, but not FrameworkField instances. This small change allows for both now, because FrameworkField's constructor has been promoted from package-private to public.

 Run all zero of our GWT tests during presubmit/CI.
Unfortunately, this does not detect any bogus  lines in test .gwt.xml files (neither the individual testModule.gwt.xml files nor the top-level GuavaTests.gwt.xml).
(And bogus  lines in prod .gwt.xml files were already detected even before this change.)
As a result, this CL appears to be very nearly a no-op -- maybe just a verification that the no-op GWT module and entry point exist. And maybe I'll end up rolling it back if we reenable the tests externally someday. Still, for now it seems like a reasonable thing to clean up, if only to prevent me from trying to clean it up again 6 months from now :)

 Check the generated PublicSuffixPatterns.java into Piper.
Copybara can't export generated files.
Also, reformat the template (and then the file) so that autoformatting the file doesn't produce diffs.

 Omit TestModuleEntryPoint from open-source repo.
Since I've disabled GWT tests in the open-source repo, these no longer serve a purpose. (They're still listed in our testModule.gwt.xml files, but as noted in a previous commit, the GWT test infrastructure doesn't seem to care what we put in those files anymore.)
We could still include them, but they're generated during our build, so that complicates exporting them with Copybara.

I'm not sure how much value the remaining open-source GwtTestSuite file provides us. Hopefully it's at least a sanity check on .gwt.xml files. But I haven't tested by breaking a .gwt.xml file to see what happens.

 Tweak TODOs.

 Remove a couple GwtSerializationDependencies classes from open-source Guava after all.
As noted in 0cb89dd, this isn't necessary. As also noted there, we have additional FooGwtSerializationDependencies classes that I'm leaving in place because they are supertypes of the prod classes and thus harder to remove.
But I'm removing these 2 because it saves me a few lines in the Copybara config :)

 Begin tweaking Guava sources to satisfy Copybara.

Change from http to https (and from github.io links to guava.dev/truth.dev while I'm at it).
Remove go/ links.
Add whitespace around MOE directives.
Put MOE stripping directives alone in comments, moving other comment text to a separate comment.
One particular case of that: Put MOE intracomment stripping into HTML comments... even when it happens in non-Javadoc comments (i.e., /* */). It seems that Copybara wants for intracomment directives to stand alone in some kind of comment?
Add @GoogleInternal to some files that are currently omitted from Guava simply by not being in MOE filegroup targets.

This is surely not a complete set of changes, but it's enough to get me started.

Commits:
 Fully remove GWT-RPC support externally.
Really, really closes #3680.
Possible future work:

Be consistent about whether we put @GwtCompatible on the remaining internal CustomFieldSerializer classes. (For those files, it probably acts only as documentation (of something that is pretty obvious :)). Our open-source build used to take action when it saw @GwtCompatible(emulated=true), but (a) it doesn't anymore, (b) those files don't exist externally anymore, and (c) they weren't emulated=true :) I believe that our internal build requires @GwtCompatible on most files in our GWT target, but I think there's an exception for GWT-target-only sources.)
Remove some of the GwtSerializationDependencies classes. However, some of these classe are set up as supertypes of our prod classes, so this would require some surgery. Keeping them is harmless: It doesn't actually make the classes GWT-serializable.
Remove the usages of serializable=true on @GwtCompatible, at least externally but maybe just entirely.

RELNOTES=Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC. Even the earlier, temporary way to reenable support (guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc) no longer has an effect.
4d2eb90

 Mark BigDecimalMathTest as fully @GwtIncompatible.
Currently it has every member annotated as @GwtIncompatible. This works fine internally, but the external GWT tests (which we run only at release time) complain about the resulting empty BigDecimalMathTest_gwt:

 Don't directly call ByteBuffer, etc. methods that have covariant returns in Java 9+.
Doing so produces a jar that doesn't work under Java 8.
This CL addresses the currently existing problematic calls (by calling the methods on the supertype Buffer instead), but we should also add safeguards.
The normal solution to this general problem is to use --release, but doing so here is complicated.

 Fix memory-leaks in LocalCache on iOS, caused by:


Retain-cycle between outer LocalCache instance and inner Values, KeySet and EntrySet instances. The use of @weak and @WeakOuter is incorrect there, since inner instances can outlive outer LocalCache instance. The correct solution is to use @RetainedWith annotation to inner-classes.


Retain-cycle between ReferenceEntry objects which internally form a doubly-linked list. Fixed by adding @weak annotation to ""next"" and ""previous"" links. This is correct, since ReferenceEntry instances are already retained by Segments.


The unit test for leak detection is added inside Xplat, because the required testing infrastructure is not present inside ""google_common"" (the IosAsserts class). Eventually, everything should be moved to ""google_common"".

Set should be serializable when T is serializable but that is not always the case for the set returned by ImmutableMap.keySet() due to a reference from the returned set back to the original map.

 Unconditionally call setException for RejectedExecutionException.
Under JDK11, the write to thrownByExecute / thrownFromDelegate is upsetting TSAN. I suspect that TSAN is incorrect (and that it is likely to identify the same ""problem"" in other code).
However, we years ago questioned whether the code I'm removing served any real purpose...
(fixes #2877)
...so now seems like a good time to get rid of it and, at minimum, hopefully eliminate the current TSAN failure.
The code that we're running in the executor is under our control. (That is, we're the ones who implement Runnable.run().) We're catching exceptions (and thus any RejectedExecutionException) in the obvious places. Occasionally we do call listeners, but naturally we do that only after completing the future or at least calling setFuture (after which a stray setException(rejectedExecutionException) would be a no-op).
The one(?) exception to that is that InterruptibleTask.run() can call currentThread.interrupt(), which we learned a few years ago can call arbitrary code through nio callbacks. At some point, though, I throw my hands up and say ""whatever.""
(If the interrupt were to be a problem, it would have to be with an executor that executes tasks inline, like directExecutor. But I note that rejectionPropagatingExecutor, at least, already defends against this for directExecutor itself (by skipping the RejectedExecutionException logic entirely). So the danger exists only with CombinedFutureInterruptibleTask or with a non-directExecutor that can execute tasks inline without catching exceptions -- and again, only in concert with nio interrupt callbacks. I think.)

 Speed up Traverser and cut about 30 lines of code.
When stacked against the unsubmitted Walker, before the change:
breadthFirst was roughly on par;
preOrder/postOrder were about 70% slower (1359 vs. 2358);
After adopting the Walker impl, the tree traversal preorder/postorder are improved close to Walker impl.
There is still about 10% slowness (2405 vs. 2268) remaining, which I suspect is due to Iterator being slower than Spliterator, because with Spliterator, we can tryAdvance() once for each element, while with Iterator, we have to call both hasNext() and next().
The graph traversal adoption is similar, with about 15% remaining slowness compared to Walker (1583 vs. 1338), which is likely result of Spliterator.tryAdvance() vs. Iterator.hasNext() + next().
Did not adopt the Walker's breadth-first impl for the following reasons:

Adopting the Walker's breadth-first impl contributed about 10% slowdown compared to the current impl. I think this is likely due to the eager foreach loop of the successors in the current breadth-first iterator. In the full traversal benchmark, it's likely faster than consuming the successor iterator lazily.

On the other hand, the breadth-first iterator is inconsistent with the depth-first iterators that consume the successor iterators lazily.
For follow-up: It might be better to go complete lazy for breadth-first, even at the cost of 10% slowdown in the full-traversal benchmark. Plus we can reuse code and delete the two existing BreadthFirstIterator classes.
I'm going to add the benchmark class in the the labs directory to compare between Iteration and Traverser.

Reuse ThreadFactory in MoreExecutors,cla: yes package=concurrent status=will-not-fix type=performance,,,"dennyac: Currently we create a new ThreadFactory instance whenever we call MoreExecutors.newThread()
Just changing it to reuse the same instance. The only usage of platformThreadFactory() is in MoreExecutors.newThread() and they set the name of the thread in that method..netdpb: The instance returned by Executors.defaultThreadFactory() can be functionally different after System.setSecurityManager() is called, and in any case the thread names are different for different returned objects.
While maybe rare, these are not insignificant bits of configuration.
What's the value of making this change, compared to that not well known but nonzero cost? I don't think anyone's worried about performance aspects of creating thread factories..dennyac: @netdpb - The threadName is always overwritten in MoreExecutors.newThread() which is the only place it is used.

But, if someone sets the SecurityGroup and overrides getThreadGroup(), then functionality will change for threads created after that.

 Ensure QueueWorker does not outlive SequentialExecutor on iOS.
When SequentialExecutor is used on iOS as J2ObjC-transpiled code, we need to
make sure that SequentialExecutor.QueueWorker does not outlive its outer
class. Previously, because the inner class was annotated with @WeakOuter, it
could happen, and, when this happened, the inner class would then invoke
methods on a dangling pointer and crash the process in turn. The issue is now
fixed by annotating the worker field in the outer class with @RetainedWith.
Although @RetainedWith was initially designed for bimaps, the annotation
addresses exactly the lifecycle problem here.

Issue #3742 Changing the axesSizeProduct entries to Integer.MAX_VALUE instead of throwing exception,cla: no,,,"HelenaGregg: #3742 said that they would like to be able to create a Sets::cartesianProduct object that would have more than 2^31-1 elements in the resulting set. Currently, it throws an IllegalArgumentException when this happens. @Meijuh said that since ""java.util.Set::size() specifies that if the size would be more than Integer.MAX_VALUE it would simply be Integer.MAX_VALUE"" this should be fixed.
So the code change is that instead of throwing an exception, the remaining lower parts of the axesSizeProduct integer array are set to Integer.MAX_VALUE so the size function (which returns axesSizeProduct[0]) will now return Integer.MAX_VALUE..googlebot: Thanks for your pull request.

Make singletons' constructors private,cla: yes,,,"aczaplinski: No description provided..cky: I'm not on the Guava team. However, I've looked at Guava code for a long time, and generally, Guava leans heavily on implicit trust for package-private code. In this instance, for example, the Guava team probably trusts that there won't be any internal code that would try to instantiate those classes directly.
Besides, if the Guava team did want to make this change for some reason, the usual Effective Java pattern for singletons is to use a one-constant enum..aczaplinski: The one-constant enum singleton implementation can't be applied in these cases - the classes extend some other classes, which enums in Java can't do..cgdecker: While in general it's preferable to have a private constructor for singletons, this doesn't really buy us anything in this case.",2020-04-03T12:47:47Z,2020-04-08T21:09:42Z,1,2,4

Hi, I have reviewed the discussion. But I think the expected behavior should not throw an exception.
According to the discussion, they are confused on why iter.hasNext() is true. Actually, it is because class Partition use Iterator from superclass AbstractList. And the hasNext() function in class AbstractList is not perfect. They have been optimized in subclass ArrayList.Plese review below
This is hasNext in AbstractList class. It call size() function
public boolean hasNext() {
    return cursor != size();
} 

This is hasNext in ArrayList class. It use value size. And the documentation said it is An optimized version of AbstractList.Itr. I see this in JDK1.8
public boolean hasNext() {
    return cursor != size;
}

when use fuction size(), every time propram call hasNext(). The hasNext() will call size(), then the value size will be recalculated. Back to the code from #3570, when the propram execute removeall(), the recalculate size will be 0, but the cursor is 1. so the hasNext() return true.
example code in #3570
for(List<Integer> l : ll){
   l.removeAll(elementExclude);
}

So I introduce listsize to save the value to make sure it only be calculated once.
I also tested below code. I use ArrayList as container and then do the same removeAll operation. No exception is throw. So, I think the behavior of partition should be same
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList();
        list.add(1);
        List<Integer> elementExclude = new ArrayList();
        elementExclude.add(1);
        
        List<List<Integer>> ll = new ArrayList();
        
        ll.add(list);
        for(List<Integer> l : ll){

            l.removeAll(elementExclude);

 Store each result in a ""Present"" instance instead of an Optional.
We can't store a plain V because we need to distinguish between Optional.absent() and null (at least in the Google-internal successfulAsMap -- and eventually in whenAllComplete(...).collectToList() (#1519), which is likely to omit failures instead of mapping them to null as successfulAsList does).
We may have problems using Optional when we adopt new nullability annotations, since Optional might not be a valid instantiation when V is instantiated with a nullable type.

 Make lenientToString easier for nullness-analysis tools to understand.
And I think prevent it from turning a StackOverflowError into a NullPointerException in unlikely cases?
As far as tools know, String.valueOf is capable of throwing an Error or RuntimeException, even when it's called with a parameter whose values is null. Thus, tools conclude that the flow of the program might reach o.getClass().getName() when o is null. That would in turn produce NullPointerException.
Tools might not even be wrong, since String.valueOf could produce a StackOverflowError if we were just about to run out of space. Of course, in that case we're going to have problems in the catch() block no matter what... :)
To avoid this, we check for null in lenientToString itself.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..cpovirk: A couple quick thoughts, since I sadly doubt that I'll be able to dedicate a lot of time to this:


I somewhat like to create the collection on one line and add to it on another if I am then going to also remove from it (or add more to it), like here. The multi-line process is a hint that there's going to be more to the collection than just its initial contents. That is, we're not just making a defensive copy. However, this is a minor point, and others might not see it that way. Plus, we're usually modifying the collection immediately after creating, so there's not much danger of confusion.


For cases in which we add objects and then add more objects, I'm not sure that we necessarily improve performance by presizing to the size of the first set of objects, like here. It might actually be better to accept the default size.


The unfortunate thing is that this code does need some performance tuning and general cleaning. I just fear that it would be a big investment..zhangt2333: @cpiotr
Thanks for your code review. This PR was submitted for the following reasons :

Using the constructor with parameter, it can save one time array copy.
Improving readability and polishing the code.

But I agree with your thoughts :

For the contextual semantic unity in a block of code.
The performance improvement may be small.
More time can be allocated for implementing features and fixing bugs

I respect your decision, so what should I do?.cpovirk: Thanks. I'm going to skip DerivedCollectionGenerators.java, since I'm not sure if that will help or hurt performance.

Corporate signers

Your company has a Point of Contact who decides which employees are authorized to participate. Ask your POC to be added to the group of authorized contributors. If you don't know who your Point of Contact is, direct the Google project maintainer to go/cla#troubleshoot (Public version).
The email used to register you as an authorized contributor must be the email used for the Git commit. Check your existing CLA data and verify that your email is set on your git commits.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..ElliottBrossard: I submitted the corporate CLA on behalf of Snowflake, but I need our authorized signer (our VP) to click through the agreement still. Once that happens, I'll trigger the cla/google check again..ElliottBrossard: Hmm is there a way to see the test outputs for Travis CI? The log indicates that the new test fails, but I don't see that /home/travis/build/google/guava/guava-tests/target/surefire-reports is made available anywhere....cpovirk: On the job log page, you can scroll way to the bottom and click the $ util/print_surefire_reports.sh line and -- I see that it's not working :( I will have a look. Sorry about that..cpovirk: Odd. It works for me locally (also maven-surefire-plugin:2.7.2, though only Maven 3.5). I wonder what's different about Travis.
If you're lucky, the problem will reproduce for you locally:
mvn clean install ""-Dtest.include=**/AbstractFutureInnocuousThreadTest.java""
(You can probably skip the clean part, but I am always nervous about doing so.).cpovirk: OK, I patched in your PR, so I have updates on 2 fronts:
First, the failure is this:
testAbstractFutureInitializationWithInnocuousThread_doesNotThrow(com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFutureInnocuousThreadTest)  Time elapsed: 0.151 sec  <<< ERROR!
java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (""java.lang.RuntimePermission"" ""closeClassLoader"")
  at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(AccessControlContext.java:472)
  at java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(AccessController.java:884)
  at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(SecurityManager.java:549)
  at java.net.URLClassLoader.close(URLClassLoader.java:289)
  at com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFutureInnocuousThreadTest.tearDown(AbstractFutureInnocuousThreadTest.java:80)
...

I am able to reproduce it locally -- but not when using the test.include flag from my previous post. It's possible that this means that your test is affected by a previous test's incomplete cleanup or other poor hygiene (AbstractFutureFallbackAtomicHelperTest? AbstractFutureCancellationCauseTest?).
Second, I'm not completely sure what's up with util/print_surefire_reports.sh. Locally, I get a ""successful"" run but with no results with your commit patched in. That's because I'm seeing .xml files for most tests but not seeing one for your test. Maybe that's related to the SecurityManager?
I don't know why the situation would be different under Travis, under which there are apparently no .xml files.....cpovirk: Now I am more confused!
In an attempt to narrow down which tests were causing the problem, I ran:
mvn clean install ""-Dtest.include=%regex[.*util.concurrent.*.class]""
That got this far:
Running com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutionThreadServiceTest
Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.09 sec
Running com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFutureCancellationCauseTest
Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.042 sec
Running com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFutureFallbackAtomicHelperTest
Tests run: 42, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 33.034 sec
Running com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFutureInnocuousThreadTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.073 sec

Those all appear to be successes. But then the run aborted, claiming:
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.7.2:test (default-test) on project guava-tests: There are test failures.

So I'm not sure what's up. Hopefully it will be clearer to you from the code..ElliottBrossard: Thanks for taking a look! I wonder if resetting the SecurityManager to its original state at the end of the test would fix the problem...I'll give that a shot locally without the test filter and then see if it passes, then see if another Travis run will succeed..ElliottBrossard: I really wish I could see the test output from Travis...I tried resetting the SecurityManager with System.setSecurityManager(null); at the end of the test, and both mvn clean install ""-Dtest.include=%regex[.*util.concurrent.*.class]"" and mvn clean install ""-Dtest.include=**/AbstractFutureInnocuousThreadTest.java"" pass for me now, but it looks like the tests through Travis are still failing based on the result above :(
Is /home/travis/build/google/guava/guava-tests/target/surefire-reports kept around in any logs/outputs?.ElliottBrossard: Let's check on the CLA status at least, since we submitted the corporate one:
@googlebot I signed it!.ElliottBrossard: @googlebot I signed it!.googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!
‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..ElliottBrossard: Woohoo, the CLA check passes now.
Separately, though, I found a way to avoid depending on ForkJoinPool within Arrow Flight, so it's fine if AbstractFuture tries to access properties, and I'm not blocked on this PR any more. I'm happy to try to see it to completion, but it's not urgent in any case..cpovirk: Thanks! I grabbed your test and tweaked it to use a custom SecurityManager subclass instead of writing a policy file. That appears to be enough to get mvn clean install to pass. Do you have any comments on the result, #3795?.cpovirk: (You can ignore the second copy of the files (from the android directory). I probably should have omitted that copy from the PR.).ElliottBrossard: Nice, LGTM! Thanks for figuring out a way to make it work. It sounds like this project doesn't merge changes from Github anyway, so we can close this PR if you want to proceed with submitting your version to google3 (and then I'm assuming the changes get exported to Github at some point)..cpovirk: Right, we'll make the equivalent change internally and then mirror it back out (with your name attached). That will automatically close this PR, so we can keep it open just in case I somehow forget about it :)",2020-01-29T17:54:43Z,2020-02-07T02:44:29Z,1,0,4

 Ensure that we generate a non-empty Javadoc jar for guava-gwt.
Without it, we get an error during Sonatype deployment:

I hacked around this on the GitHub release branch for 28.2 by reenabling Javadoc:

But as you may recall from CL 276327335, we're soon going to have no classes to generate Javadoc for (after we remove GWT-RPC support). So even with Javadoc generation enabled, we'd end up with no jar.
To ensure that we get a jar, I've introduced a package-private dummy class (and then excluded it from the other steps in which source files are used).

 Stop classifying AbstractHashFloodingTest as a test to be run directly.
When it's classified as a test to be run directly, our custom infrastructure generates AbstractHashFloodingTest_gwt, and Maven tries to run it, failing with:
No tests found in com.google.common.collect.AbstractHashFloodingTest_gwt
Ideally, our infrastructure would recognize that an abstract class could never be run directly, at which point we wouldn't need to manually classify tests like this. But I don't remember seeing this problem in a long time, so we probably won't bother.

RELNOTES=Fix bug in AbstractNetwork.hasEdgeConnecting() causing it to throw if either endpoint was not in the graph.  Originally reported as GitHub issue #3721.
8e0f821

 Refactor AbstractGraphTest to allow for tests with ImmutableGraph.
Reason: ImmutableGraph implementations are undertested compared to MutableGraph implementations. The current tests didn't catch a bug I deliberately introduced in [] Also, it would be nice to be able to share the incident edge order tests.
Note about design: I started out by making an AbstractGraphTest subclass for mutable graphs. However, that would lead to a duplication of all 7 subclasses and most of their tests. The issue is that directed/undirected and mutable/immutable are orthogonal and we also want to test allowSelfLoops=true/false and incidentEdgeOrder=unordered/stable. The proposed solution is somewhat unconventional, but at least allows us to share much more code between the tests.

 Merge AbstractXGraphTest and ConfigurableSimpleXGraphTest, thus removing one layer from the AbstractGraphTest tree.
Reason: Nobody in [] is using these abstract test classes (even though they are designed for general purpose graphs). However, even though they aren't used, these classes add a layer of complexity to an already complex class tree that is going to become more complex with the addition of ImmutableGraph tests and stable incident edge order tests.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..sbabcoc: @googlebot I signed it!.cgdecker: The constructor/methods in question were @Beta APIs that were deprecated in Guava 22 and removed in 23, in accordance to our @Beta policy. No library should have been using @Beta APIs, and while it's unfortunate that some libraries have over the years, we're not planning to re-add APIs we removed because of that..sbabcoc: @cgdecker I understand that the decision of the Selenium implementers to use a @Beta interface was ill-advised, but development on Selenium 2 shut down before switching to the final form of TimeLimiter. Selenium 3 doesn't use this @Beta interface, but folks like me who still need to support Java 7 can't upgrade to Selenium 3. The constructor/method are still present in the SimpleTimeLimiter class... they're just private, and the corresponding variant of callWithTimeout has been removed from the TimeLimiter interface.
Because the Selenium 2 browser drivers rely on SimpleTimeLimiter, I currently can't upgrade Guava to any release newer than 19.0. This leaves me vulnerable to the unbounded memory allocation issue that was resolved in later Guava releases. Is there any chance you'd make an exception to your deprecation/removal policy for @Beta interfaces in this case?.sbabcoc: @cgdecker Any chance for this to be reconsidered?",2019-11-30T04:17:28Z,2019-12-09T18:09:16Z,5,3,3

Update 'adding Guava to your build using Gradle' snippet,cla: yes,,,"jjohannes: Hello from Gradle üëã
I noticed that the 'adding Guava to your build using Gradle' section in the README could use an update. So here it is.
The notation with brackets - () - and double quotes - "" - is valid in both Gradle's Groovy and Kotlin DSL. The keyword (the 'configuration') determines the scopes in which  the dependency is visible. ""compile"" is already discouraged since some time and officially deprecated with Gradle 6. ""implementation"" and ""api"" are both possible, but the initial recommendation for using a
library should be ""implementation"".
https://docs.gradle.org/6.0-rc-1/userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_recognizing_dependencies.cpovirk: Thanks! It sounds like we should definitely be moving off compile at this point.
In the past, though, we've heard people (@tbroyer, @JakeWharton) suggest that api makes a safer default than implementation:

#3154
google/auto#620

(The Auto discussion touches on especially controversial issues around annotations, which might be a distraction from the more common case -- though Guava does include annotations, too!)
Even if we do give api as a ""default"" recommendation, I can certainly see mentioning implementation, ideally by saying something like:

If you can make certain guarantees [link], then you can change api to implementation to let Gradle skip work in some cases.

...
OK, and now I actually went and read the docs you linked to :) (Thanks!) I see how implementation has its advantages beyond build speed.
I'll revise what I said above to something more like ""It's complicated"" :) I'm now not sure it makes sense to give either recommendation as a ""default.""
I would be tempted to put:

dependencies {
  some-configuration(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")
  // or, for Android:
  some-configuration(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
}

...where some-configuration is either implementation or api, as discussed in the Gradle docs.

Thoughts on that?.jjohannes: Thanks for the quick response @cpovirk. I wasn't aware that there is such a history in discussing this little snippet. :) And of course it depends a lot on whom you ask what the more sensible default is. From our side, we prefer recommending ""implementation"" because the user will have to make the explicit decision to expose it, if they are developing a library/module used by others. But I can also understand the ""some users just want it to work as before/as in Maven"" argument.
The downside of the ""some-configuration"" would be that it looses it's nice ""copy&paste"" character. Also in theory it makes sense as there are even more configurations you can use.
How about adding both?
dependencies {
  // Use Guava in your implementation
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")
  // Use Guava types in your public API
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")
  // Android: Use Guava in your implementation
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
  // Android: Use Guava types in your public API
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
}

The comments are vastly simplifying the effect, but give a rough guidance for users who absolutely have no idea..cpovirk: I am encouraged enough by tbroyer's thumbs-up to move on to tweaking wording :)

dependencies {
  // Use Guava in your implementation only:
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")
  // OR: Use Guava types in your public API:
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")
Or, for Android:
dependencies {
  // Use Guava in your implementation only:
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
  // OR: Use Guava types in your public API:
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
}

But maybe that separates the Android and non-Android cases too widely? Plus, we'd probably want to do the same for Maven, which is more verbose, so we'd end up with 4 code blocks, some of them large :\

dependencies {
  // Use Guava in your implementation only:
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")
  // OR: Use Guava types in your public API:
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")
}

// Or, for Android:

dependencies {
  // Use Guava in your implementation only:
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
  // OR: Use Guava types in your public API:
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
}

That would mean only 2 code blocks (Gradle and Maven), and maybe we can get away with keeping the Maven one as it is?
I don't know, or:

dependencies {
  // Pick one:

  // 1. Use Guava in your implementation only:
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")

  // 2. Use Guava types in your public API:
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre"")

  // 3. Android - Use Guava in your implementation only:
  implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")

  // 4. Android - Use Guava types in your public API:
  api(""com.google.guava:guava:28.1-android"")
}

Maybe I like that one?
(Whatever we do, we should link to the nice Gradle docs.).jjohannes: I also like the last suggestion. With the newlines in between it's more readable than what I suggested. I think it's good to keep having one block for Maven and one for Gradle. Then it's easier to spot that each is about one tool.

 Use int[] for entries and byte[]/short[]/int[] for hashtable
The entries array containing the hash and next index was reduced from a long[]
to int[]. This is achieved by storing only the bits of the hash not covered by
the hashtable mask; the bits covered by the hashtable mask are implied-by and
can be inferred-from the hashtable bucket index. By ensuring that next pointers
are always less than or equal to the hashtable mask, everything needed can be
packed into an int[]. Inferring the missing hash bits from the hashtable bucket
index is only required for rehashing (the hashtable bucket chains must be
walked) and is the source of the slowdown for unsized instances.
The hashtable is created as a byte[]/short[]/int[] based on size, stored as an
Object, and cast to the correct type using instanceof checks.
Android performance impact varies but stays within +/-15% (average: 3% better).
JVM performance impact generally stays within +/-15% but unsized instances are
up to 42% worse (average: 5% worse).

 Fix Javadoc errors (and sometimes warnings).

 Make inheriting Javadoc from the JDK work under JDK11.
131e1b6

 Prepare to move gwt-user to test scope after we remove GWT-RPC support.
When we do that, we'll no longer be able to compile ForceGuavaCompilationEntryPoint as part of the normal javac compile or build its Javadoc (because of the ""missing"" dependency).
(ForceGuavaCompilationEntryPoint lives under the main (i.e., non-test) sources because we want to ensure that our prod code compiles without any dependencies added by our tests.)
So exclude it from the javac compile, and turn off building Javadoc altogether. (Javadoc already isn't useful for guava-gwt, since it covers only ForceGuavaCompilationEntryPoint and the internal serialization classes. Once the serialization classes go away and ForceGuavaCompilationEntryPoint is hidden, we would get an error from Javadoc because it wouldn't find any sources.)
Removing ForceGuavaCompilationEntryPoint from the javac compile is fine: I've verified that the GWT compiler still runs and identifies any GWT compilation errors. And I've diffed the resulting GWT jars.
While here, I moved some GWT-specific configuration into the guava-gwt pom.xml.

 Attempt to fix inheriting Javadoc from the JDK again.
It's currently missing:
https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/primitives/UnsignedInteger.html#equals-java.lang.Object-
But I haven't managed to reproduce the problem locally.
I'm trying this on the theory that java.home might be pointing to the JDK (the top-level directory in which src.zip lives) rather than the JRE (a subdirectory).
Note that JDK11 has src.zip in a lib/ subdirectory. I tried adding it to a Java 11 build of Guava, but things blew up because the JDK contains module declarations, which naturally are incompatible with our -source 8. Possibly the right fix there is to avoid -source 8 in favor of the approach I used for jimfs in CL 272937179 -- except that maybe I already tried that and it wasn't sufficient? I'm happy to punt on that for now, especially since I just tried removing -source 8 and got a bunch of ""too many module declarations found"" errors :)

A StatsAccumulator.addAll overload that takes StatsAccumulator.

(In passing, this also improves the tests in a couple of ways. It removes the use of static initializer blocks in StatsTesting, which is contrary to best practice. And it fixes some tolerances on the assertions: the min() and max() ones should use exact equality, and the ones with INTEGER_MANY_VALUES and LONG_MANY_VALUES should scale up the tolerance to match the order of magnitude of the values. This latter change fixes the ErrorProne warnings that, in some cases, the tolerance was actually less than the difference between the expected value and the next nearest double. It just happened that everything was close enough before.)

 Log warnings for users who send Guava types over GWT-RPC.
I've left this change out of the Android branch. For starters, it's not necessary there, since we don't support GWT. But normally we'd include it anyway to minimize diffs. However, doing so increases the number of classes retained after running Proguard (thanks, I assume, to the Logger field). There are other ways of getting around this, but for a temporary feature, the diffs seem tolerable.

Make animal sniffer annotations optional,cla: yes,Stephan202,,"elharo: Per https://www.mojohaus.org/animal-sniffer/animal-sniffer-annotations/ this should not be inherited by dependents
@cpovirk.cpovirk: I think the case for this is a little better than the case for AutoValue's annotations, but I still have my doubts.
I think the overall consensus that annotation-only packages should be optional or provided is wrong, as discussed in the AutoValue thread. There are two main cases:

Omitting an annotation-only dependency can cause failures with -Xlint:all -Werror. The good news is that I haven't been able to produce this failure unless the annotation has elements. And the single Animal Sniffer annotation has no elements -- yet, anyway :) That doesn't mean that success is guaranteed, though, only that it happens to work now. I don't think that javac makes guarantees about incomplete classpaths in general, though I could be wrong.
Omitting an annotation-only dependency can cause problems with plugins, annotation processors, etc. For example, I could imagine static analysis that checks, if any annotation is declared on both a class and its superclass, whether that annotation is @Inherited (so that it can suggest removing it from the subclass). This static analysis would need to load all annotations. Now, it can just skip checking an annotation if the annotation class isn't available, but I'm not sure we can say that we're doing the right thing if we force that. And maybe the static analysis would be more important than my example, involving security or something. For example, there are systems that let you define that code annotated with one annotation ""implies"" one or more other annotations. So if security-critical static analysis sees @MyFoo on a method, then it might need to look at @MyFoo to make sure that it doesn't imply something like @CompileTimeConstant.

So I think that including annotations is still the right thing to do by default. The typical guidance I've seen to make them provided or optional doesn't even consider these issues, so I don't think we should put much stock in it.
I assume that the goal here is to avoid version conflicts. Is this a case in which the Linkage Checker can detect that it's harmless to have different but identical versions of the class file present?.elharo: The purpose of animal sniffer is for compile time checking of the project with animal sniffer. That's it. These annotations don't have any use post-compile..elharo: I also think it's important that a fundamental library such as Guava minimize its dependency tree, ideally to the JDK, full stop. However between animal sniffer, error prone, and others Guava has slowly been accumulating a lot of additional dependencies that are transitively appearing in other projects. Every dependency is a liability..cpovirk: They have class retention, though, so they'll be in the output. Maybe they shouldn't be, but arbitrary tools don't know that :( Maybe file a bug against Animal Sniffer?.elharo: Good idea. Done: mojohaus/animal-sniffer#73
We'll see what the animal sniffer devs say, but I'm guessing the plugin is analyzing the .class files rather than the .java files, which would explain why they want class retention with an optional dependency. The linkage checker operates similarly. We read .class files, not .java files..cpovirk: Ah, you're probably right.
I found the following in some docs (the same ones as you linked above):

Animal sniffer also allows you to specify your own custom annotation if needed. Check the configuration of the relevant task for more information.

So maybe we can provide our own..cpovirk: http://www.mojohaus.org/animal-sniffer/animal-sniffer-maven-plugin/check-mojo.html#annotations.cpovirk: I think that the impact of annotation-only packages is fairly small as liabilities go. Or at the very least, if it's safe to omit the packages entirely, then it's likely to be safe to have the wrong version present.
Still, I think it would be fine to migrate our one usage of @IgnoreJRERequirement to a custom, package-private implementation, configuring Animal Sniffer to recognize that, even if that feels like primarily a symbolic victory to me..elharo: Should that approach (moving to a package private custom implementation) start in google3 or here?.cpovirk: google3 is marginally easier for us, but I'm fine with whatever you prefer..elharo: It seems the pom.xml only lives here so probably easier to work from github..cpovirk: A search like f:guava/pom.xml should turn it up in google3, but again, here is fine if that's easier..elharo: Closing this in favor of #3652",2019-10-09T14:32:28Z,2019-10-10T15:06:47Z,2,0,4

 Address TSAN errors:


Suppress safe racy init in AbstractMultiset and HashBiMap. All the classes that are stored in the newly annotated fields have only final fields (except HashBiMap.Inverse, which inherits AbstractBiMap's keySet and values fields, which are themselves @LazyInit), so they are safe to read racily.


Mark some graph ""cache"" fields as volatile. These fields are an optimization: When the user accesses an entry through iteration (and sometimes through get(...)), the graph stores the entry in a field. That way, if the user then queries it again (such as to look up the value associated with a key during iteration), the graph doesn't have to perform a potentially mildly expensive lookup. But this caching isn't implemented in a thread-safe way. It ought to be safe to initialize a graph in one thread, safely publish it, and then read it concurrently from other threads. But because of the racy reads of the cached entry fields, I don't think this is guaranteed to be safe.

As you said, when two arguments are not constant, Math.max or Math.min is easy to understand, so the modifications to the toSafeNanos method make sense; for the other two methods, I think using Math.max method is also very readable, because it is easy to see that our intention is to get the number that is greater than 0 or -1..netdpb: I'm still not really seeing how what you have is significantly simpler to read than what's there.

Commits:
 Release the input futures as soon as we submit the combiner task. But really, redo how we release resources in general.
This is a followup to CL 265489523, which ""only"" released the input futures as soon as the combiner task finished running (which had often happened even before that CL but hadn't if the combiner returned a Future that was still pending). That CL was good enough for practical purposes, but I wanted to better understand how we release resources.
This CL standardizes on AggregateFuture.releaseResources() as the way to null out all fields[*], merging logic from releaseResources(), releaseResourcesAfterFailure(), and AsyncCallableInterruptibleTask.setValue(...). As part of that, it merges AggregateFuture and AggregateFutureState/RunningState into a single object.
[*] OK, except seenExceptions, which gets its own handling. As a bonus, I believe that this CL clears seenExceptions earlier than it used to be cleared in the CombinedFuture case. Specifically, it clears it when all inputs are done, rather than when the combiner task has finished running.
It turns out that blindly nulling out fields is too aggressive, so we need to be careful in 2 cases:


CombinedFuture.releaseResources() can't null out task until the future is done or the task is done running. That's because it may need to interrupt the task. To handle this, I don't null out task in releaseResources() unless isDone(). To ensure that task still gets nulled out as soon as it's done running, I null it out directly in afterRanInterruptibly(). (OK, this is another exception to my claim that releaseResources() handles nulling out ""all"" fields....)


Even if the output future is done, processCompleted() sometimes needs access to the original futures in order to see whether any of them failed. To handle this, I store them in the listener and pass them through to processCompleted() (when necessary).


The changes to prod code are net negative in line count, at least ignoring the added comments. I've also added a couple tests, only one of which passed before this CL. And I think the model for when fields are nulled out is overall clearer after this CL. So hopefully this CL is a step forward, despite the complexity of the changes and the remaining complexity in the code. (I also included a few unrelated simplifications, like not bothering to check collectsValues before calling collectOneValue(...).)
(Aside: This CL's releaseResources() is like our proposed afterCommit() API but different. First, releaseResources() may be called even before set() or setAsync() in the CombinedFuture case. Second, CombinedFuture may rely on the fact that it's called twice in some cases: It's called once when all inputs complete, but it doesn't null out task, and then it can be called again if the output is cancelled, at which point it does null out task. But that probably doesn't matter too much because the task was probably handed to an executor in the meantime, so CombinedFuture is unlikely to hold the final reference to it. Anyway, for more discussion of afterCommit(), see #2886)

 Fix an issue where the InputStream returned by BaseEncoding.decodingStream(Reader) could fail to throw DecodingException while decoding an invalid string.
This was caused by the default behavior of InputStream.read(byte[], int, int), which swallows any IOException thrown by any call to the single-byte read() method other than the first. To fix it, just override that method with an implementation that does not swallow any exceptions.

optimize buffer-memory allocation,cla: yes,,,"berndhopp: This patch is to avoid unnecessary allocation of memory to create transfer-buffers to e.g. move data from an InputStream to an OutputStream by introducing a package-local class TransferBuffer to the com.google.io package. The code does not change the public API in any way.
TransferBuffers provide to package-local static methods to obtain a TransferBuffer for byte- or char-arrays, TransferBuffer.getCharArrayTransferBuffer() and TransferBuffer.getByteArrayTransferBuffer(). These are being used to avoid memory-allocation in a couple of places in the com.google.io-package,
The microbenchmarks show that avoiding buffer allocation yields a significant performance boost

As far as we know, there is no actual problem with these references because no methods are called on them. However, the new version of Animal Sniffer we're updating to will flag them anyway, and I think that avoiding them is the safe thing to do.

Rejuvenate logging statement levels,P3 cla: yes package=general status=research status=triaged type=other,,,"khatchad: Introduction
We are in the process of evaluating our research prototype Eclipse plug-in that ""rejuvenates"" log statement levels based on how ""interesting"" the enclosing methods are to the developers. The assumption is that methods that are worked on more and more recently by developers should have higher log levels (e.g., INFO as compared to FINEST). Our end goal is to reduce information overload, as well as alleviate developers from manually making log level changes.
The transformation decision is made by analyzing the ""degree of interest"" (DOI) values of enclosing methods for logging invocations. DOI value is a kind of real number for a program element which shows how developers are interested in it. It is computed from the interaction events between developer and element, such as developer edits the element. In this project, we compute the DOI using the project's git history.
We are looking for feedback on our tool from developers. If you can, we would appreciate if you can comment on each of the transformations in the case that this PR is not accepted. Of course, we would also love to contribute to your project.
Transformed Logging Statements
Here is a list of DOI values for enclosing methods of transformed log invocations in your projects:

Bug Fix
We found a bug in the same test case where only log messages having level INFO or above are tested. Now, all levels are tested. This was also a manual fix.
Settings
We have several settings to analyze these DOI values. The settings we are using in this pull request are:

Treat  CONFIG/WARNING/SEVERE level as a category and not a traditional level, i.e., our tool ignores CONFIG/WARNING/SEVERE log level (setting 1).
Never lower the logging level of logging statements within catch blocks (setting 2).
The number of commits evaluated: 1000 (setting 3).

Head: 74fc49f
We can vary these settings and rerun our if you desire.
DOI Intervals
For your information, we also generate a list of DOI value intervals. Given this list, our tool could rejuvenate log levels by knowing which intervals the DOI values of enclosing methods for log invocations are in:



subject
DOI boundary

Notes
This supersedes #3413 to workaround CLA bot issue..netdpb: Guava is a mature, low-level, general-purpose library. Because of its maturity, much of it is quite stable. It looks like your prototype took that to mean that all logging statements should be at FINEST, but I'm not sure how well your interesting theory tying logging levels to code stability applies.
I wonder whether your research is intended to apply more to application/service code than to general-purpose library code..khatchad: @netdpb Thank you for this feedback! That is a really interesting insight. You may be right! We will certainly consider it..netdpb: @khatchad I notice that the DOI values for all those logging statements are 0. Maybe you can use that in your heuristic.
I'm closing this PR for now, since I'm not sure that the suggestions apply. Feel free to reopen or to reach out to us for more discussion about your interesting project..khatchad: Thanks again @netdpb. You may want to consider the testing bug we found above in case you ever lower the levels of logs you are testing.",2019-04-04T18:27:53Z,2019-04-05T16:53:27Z,3,4,3

Rejuvenate log levels,cla: no package=testing status=triaged,,kluever,"khatchad: Introduction
We are in the process of evaluating our research prototype Eclipse plug-in that ""rejuvenates"" log statement levels based on how ""interesting"" the enclosing methods are to the developers. The assumption is that methods that are worked on more and more recently by developers should have higher log levels (e.g., INFO as compared to FINEST). Our end goal is to reduce information overload, as well as alleviate developers from manually making log level changes.
The transformation decision is made by analyzing the ""degree of interest"" (DOI) values of enclosing methods for logging invocations. DOI value is a kind of real number for a program element which shows how developers are interested in it. It is computed from the interaction events between developer and element, such as developer edits the element. In this project, we compute the DOI using the project's git history.
We are looking for feedback on our tool from developers. If you can, we would appreciate if you can comment on each of the transformations in the case that this PR is not accepted. Of course, we would also love to contribute to your project.
Transformed Logging Statements
Here is a list of DOI values for enclosing methods of transformed log invocations in your projects:

Bug Fix
We found a bug in the same test case where only log messages having level INFO or above are tested. Now, all levels are tested. This was also a manual fix.
Settings
We have several settings to analyze these DOI values. The settings we are using in this pull request are:

Treat  CONFIG/WARNING/SEVERE level as a category and not a traditional level, i.e., our tool ignores CONFIG/WARNING/SEVERE log level (setting 1).
Never lower the logging level of logging statements within catch blocks (setting 2).
The number of commits evaluated: 1000 (setting 3).

Head: 74fc49f
We can vary these settings and rerun our if you desire.
DOI Intervals
For your information, we also generate a list of DOI value intervals. Given this list, our tool could rejuvenate log levels by knowing which intervals the DOI values of enclosing methods for log invocations are in:

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..ChristianCiach: I am not a Googler, but I can't see this PR being merged. You've reformatted the entire source code, so there is no way to tell what was actually changed. In general, pull requests should touch as little surrounding code as possible.
Because of all this reformatting, the diff is useless. I cannot check if the removed deprecated methods are actually allowed to be removed. According to the guava philosophy, deprecated api will not be removed anymore unless it is marked as beta:

APIs without @beta will remain binary-compatible for the indefinite future. (Previously, we sometimes removed such APIs after a deprecation period. The last release to remove non-@beta APIs was Guava 21.0.) Even @deprecated APIs will remain (again, unless they are @beta). We have no plans to start removing things again, but officially, we're leaving our options open in case of surprises (like, say, a serious security problem)..ronshapiro: Until we've reviewed each of these tickets, I think it's worth holding off on this PR. We'll also possibly make those changes one-by-one..cgdecker: We will not be merging this. Aside from the unnecessary reformatting, removing @Beta from any API is something we need to make a decision on on a case-by-case basis (we should be prioritizing this higher than we have, but actually removing the annotation is the easy part). And @Deprecated @Beta APIs that we haven't removed yet mostly haven't been removed for internal reasons; we'll get to them.",2019-03-21T16:10:32Z,2019-05-24T15:49:24Z,4,4,6

‚ÑπÔ∏è Googlers: Go here for more info..kevinmost: Annotate checkNotNull's input and output as @nonnull

Hi. Just curious about the motivation behind this decision (well, behind part of this decision). I totally agree that ""it's pretty weird for checkNotNull() to return a @nullable value in the minds of some tools"", and am in favor of checkNotNull() returning a non-null value.
I'm just unclear on why the input is considered @NonNull now instead of @Nullable. Maybe I'm misusing it, but I use checkNotNull() as a fluent assertion on expressions where the compiler can't infer the nullability, but I know it's @NonNull. For my uses, the ideal signature would be:
@CanIgnoreReturnValue
@NonNull

"Deduplicate common logic in Uninterruptibles class, avoiding allocations",P2 cla: yes package=concurrent status=triaged type=enhancement,,cpovirk,"njhill: I recently came across this discussion around the reason for having duplicated logic in Uninterruptibles, and am offering this as an approach which avoids per-method call allocations and reflection. There is some overhead in terms of class count though, apologies if this was already discounted for that reason.
Also related: #1409.netdpb: I'll let @cpovirk comment in more detail, but the number of classes is also a sensitive issue on Android, as well as classloading on static initializers (as you do with static final fields)..cpovirk: There are also some performance concerns, even with more efficient approaches. It's not clear that they would actually matter in practice (or even exist, since I haven't benchmarked -- and probably wouldn't trust myself if I had :)), but, in particular, a large fraction of Future.get calls at Google are actually Futures.getUninterruptibly calls (by way of Futures.getDone), so some of these methods do get called a lot.
It's still possible that this is worthwhile, but in practice, we never have to edit the existing code, so I'm not too concerned about duplication from a maintenance perspective..nick-someone: Thanks for contributing, but I think we'll close this PR for now citing concerns about the class count.",2019-02-14T21:54:16Z,2019-11-05T16:00:33Z,1,0,5

I can imagine these two suggestions will cause some debate, since they have overloads that accept a @Nullable String desc for which there is no counterpart in the standard library.
One way to settle the debate could be to benchmark whether the JDK builtins are more efficient. (Objects#checkIndex is annotated @ForceInline and delegates to a @HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate, so it may be.).kevinb9n: My bigger concern is that it's confusing enough as it is for users to understand and pay attention to the key difference between an ""element index"" and a ""position index"", and one of my goals here was to educate users on that difference and prompt them to choose wisely between the two. It's quite sad that the JDK chose to implement only one of them and not even explain the situation. In all, I don't think I really want to point people that way..Stephan202: @kevinb9n fully understand. I wonder whether the JDK implementers considered the Guava naming during their implementation process.

 Swap the parameter order of the Collections.disjoint call in Sets.intersection
Collections.disjoint is implemented in such a way that it has better
performance if its 2nd parameter is the smaller of the two when both params are
instances of Set. The Sets.intersection javadoc says it has better performance
when set1 is the smaller set, but that is currently not the case for the
isEmpty operation specifically.
Our team ran into a pathological case of this where we check for an empty
intersection of two sets, one being ~5 orders of magnitude larger than the
other.

Use the class Path to represent a path instead of a String.,cla: yes package=io status=triaged,MarkMielke,cgdecker,"reudismam: Strings can be used to represent a file system path even though some classes are specifically designed for this task. For instance, java.nio.Path. It is useful to change the type of the variable to Path, since strings can be combined in an undisciplined way, which can lead to invalid paths. Second, different operating systems use different file separators, which can cause bugs..jbduncan: This seems like a good change to me! It wasn't immediately obvious to me, but I see now that packing a string into a Path (even though we unpack it immediately afterwards) ensures that an exception is thrown if the passed string doesn't represent a valid path.
So as a non-Googler this change receives my üëç..jbduncan: Although, I suppose I wonder if this change will work on Android? Does Android have java.nio.file.Path now? ü§î.jbduncan: And if so, should the File parameter for the method getClassPathEntry(File, String) be changed to a Path as well?.jbduncan: Or even the String parameter for that matter?.liach: is there more instances of such unsafe usage?.MarkMielke: I think it is important to note that most of the reasons for and against using Path instead of String, also apply to File, and it would be useful to understand why File wasn't already used in these situations.
I don't think it being a Path, or a File, guarantees that it is ""valid"" as a path. It may improve the odds, by doing additional checks - but there are likely several paths that are in fact valid, that are not possible to represent with a Path. For example... when I call ""mv some_file some_directory"", I normally spell this ""mv some_file some_directory/"", as the trailing ""/"" is valid in a Unix path, and in the case of ""mv"" it will assert that the target is a directory before potentially overwriting a file of the same name:
$ touch x
$ touch y
$ mv x y/
mv: failed to access 'y/': Not a directory
$ mv x y
$ ls -l x y
ls: cannot access 'x': No such file or directory
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mark mark 0 Dec 24 19:07 y

A Path or File will have additional overhead in processing to ensure it is valid, and to track it. At a minimum, it is a String wrapped in another class object. However, every alteration or representation may have additional processing. What is the performance overhead of switching everything from String to Path or File from a runtime perspective? How much more memory does it require? How much more CPU does it require? How is .toString() implemented, as might be commonly called?
Generally, I like the idea of Path and File, which is why I have long used File in appropriate places, and I started to switch these to Path in Java 7 and later. However, I don't think it belongs everywhere. As an example - sometimes Integer are stored in String. While it makes sense to sometimes represent it as an Integer... sometimes it is simpler and faster, to leave it as a String..2761098800: 475e3.ChristianCiach: As far as I understand the method in question, it is used to construct a URL pointing to something inside a jar file. In particular, the String parameter is used to denote the path inside the given (jar-) File.
A Path is heavily dependent on the local operating- and file system. For example, under Windows, Paths.get(...) will return a different implementation of Path than under Linux. The content of a jar file (or especially the way to reference it) is surely not related to the file system of the local host, so using Path in this context seems like the wrong thing to do..cpovirk: I'll close this, since it's not clear what the problem being solved is.

Boolean 'done' is checked twice. Necessary ?..tareqhs: Hi @jolkdarr
Double check locking improves performance by doing an initial non-synchronized optimistic check before doing the actual check inside the critical block. Theoretically, the synchronization lock will be acquired only a few times (hopefully once) reducing the overall overhead.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking.jolkdarr: Hi @tareqhs
Thanks for the reply.
For this kind of synchronization, I prefer to use an AtomicBoolean or a single short integer (0/1) avoiding the use of an object as lock..tareqhs: Hi @jolkdarr
This is a slightly different behavior. My intended behavior is that everyone depends on the outcome of the Runnable and waits for it to finish if it has not finished yet. The behavior you are describing is triggering the task only once.  Maybe we should have a separate Runnables.triggerOnce(Runnable) for that?.ben-manes: This seems similar in spirit to RunnableFuture in j.u.c..netdpb: What does this do that java.util.concurrent.FutureTask doesn't?

I don‚Äôt think the strict versioning is worth the friction it causes, but gRPC isn‚Äôt my project. As long as Guava stays up-to-date on its own dependencies and releases frequently, it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem to get a gRPC release that can support it..cpovirk: Thanks. I think gRPC agrees and is in turn doing it only for Spring. We've since cleared up some misunderstandings we had about Spring, so gRPC might be willing to back that out. Anyway, we should still do these updates.

We exclude mis-matched dependencies in our build. Yes, it is a pain, but it can be solved fully from the gRPC-side. But bumping the versions here isn't a bad thing.
I'm going to be very happy to remove failOnVersionConflict(), but we need to replace it with another check. I've not found a way to check requireUpperBoundDeps from Gradle (for obvious reasons). I think we may be forced to have a ""test Maven project"" just to run requireUpperBoundDeps..cpovirk: I've not found a way to check requireUpperBoundDeps from Gradle (for obvious reasons).

Building large sets in ImmutableSet.RegularSetBuilderImpl regressed with change mentioned in the issue, with a slightly gain over the original performance.
Instead of deduplicating all elements and rehashing when table needs to expand, we keep a list of overflow tables, and only deduplicate within each hashtable. This saves work from consistently rehashing elements while still allowing deduplication of elements as they come.
JMH benchmarks results (Note: small set is 3 distinct elements, large set is 1000000 insertions, 500000 distinct elements, elements are Integers, building is add() and build() operations)

From Java 1.6 > the plus operator is changed into StringBuilder by compiler.

However, the compiler uses invokedynamic instructions since Java 9 (OK, Guava is not yet compiled against Java 9+, but what about the future? What about future Java versions using something different than invokedynamic?).Maaartinus: @ogregoire IMHO this all doesn't matter here. The plus operator gets changed to something, but this only for a single expression. Maybe even for a sequence like String s = ...; s += ""a""; s += 5; ..., but not for an arbitrarily complex code containing conditionals like here. With Java 8, there are multiple StringBuilders there....ogregoire: @Maaartinus What I meant is that something that is true today might become false tomorrow. His basic assumption that + is translated to StringBuilder's append from Java 6 onwards is proven as false with Java 9's indy concat..Maaartinus: @ogregoire Right, things do change all the time. But the OP could have formulated his assumption like ""+ gets optimized and it's unclear when using StringBuilder is faster"". This uncertainty will most probably stay, I can even imagine cases when + wins as it's simpler to optimize a virtual concat(""("", a, "":"", b, "")"") than the corresponding string-building expression (as an extreme, the right coder and exact count could be determined upfront and the array reused without copying). But that's pretty OT.....lowasser: I'm pretty sure that's the intent of http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/280....lowasser: I'm with @MarkMielke: the current code as-is works just fine and there is no need for a change here.",2018-07-30T05:23:23Z,2018-08-13T17:07:01Z,1,0,7

Move most information about the latest release to the release badge at the top, which now links to the GitHub release page for the latest release and automatically displays the latest release version number.
Note: I probably would have removed explicit references to the latest version number entirely (meaning no changes to it need to be made when a new release is created) except for the fact that the release process currently relies on there being some change made when prepare_release is run so that the release script knows what commit to create the release from. There are ways we could deal with that, but I didn't want to deal with that yet.

Isn't implementation the same as compile, with api being the optimisation? :/.jbduncan: @JakeWharton Wait, I'm challenging myself now. I realise that I'm not 100% clear on the difference between api and implementation, so never mind. :).JakeWharton: No. Compile transitively exposes the dependency on the classpath of
downstream modules which is the same as api. Implementation hides the
dependency. Of course Gradle doesn't enforce or validate any of this so
it's a giant footgun unless you know what you're doing.

It sounds like compile may be deprecated..JakeWharton: I believe 'api' only exists for JRE projects if you're using the
'java-library' plugin. If you're using the regular 'java' plugin you only
get 'compile' and 'implementation' (the idea being you're a leaf node and
don't have anywhere to expose dependencies to).

 ..jbduncan: @cpovirk compile is indeed deprecated. :).cpovirk: Huh. So is the idea that Android projects are more likely to use the java-library plugin? If anything, I might have naively guessed they were less likely :) Is it just that the default Android build setup suggests java-library or something?.JakeWharton: Android projects use neither. API and implementation are available for all
Android plugins for about a year now. The reason these PRs are sweeping the
web is that they now wan when you use compile.

 ..cpovirk: Ah! Thanks..jbduncan: Hmm. It sounds to me that implementation is the most sensible default, and api should be used only if the java-library plugin is imported and the given project wants to expose Guava types to its users. Is my understanding correct @JakeWharton?.JakeWharton: Your understanding is correct because you understand the implications.
Anyone who needs to look at the README to figure out how to add Guava
beyond maybe just copy/pasting the coordinates will not have that
understanding.

 ..jbduncan: @JakeWharton Cool! So you're suggesting api here because it's the most liberal option and most equivalent to the older compile, am I right?.cpovirk: (Even for people who don't expose Guava in their APIs, I'd be a little nervous about excluding transitive dependencies from the classpath, given problems with static analyzers and perhaps annotation processors discussed in #2824 and #2721. (There could also be problems if people use Guava annotations but don't consider that ""exposing an API,"" but that seems less likely.) I suppose that those problems are relatively unlikely to affect people, though.).cpovirk: Anyway, I do like the idea of suggesting the thing that is more likely to work (even if it's slower in some cases -- and I suspect only marginally so, since Guava isn't going to be changing between one build and the next). It is a little sad that this exports Guava to downstream targets, but that seems like the lesser evil (and no worse than what people see today).
One final thought: We could decide to give instructions for each of...

Java 8+
Java 7
Android

...where the Java 7 instructions look like the current Android instructions and the Android instructions look like your new ones. But I'm not sure that's worth the potential confusion..jbduncan: @cpovirk I think it's worth at least changing the remaining compile instruction for ""guava-jre"" to api, so that the Gradle installation instructions are consistent. :).cpovirk: @jbduncan, @JakeWharton said above:

I believe 'api' only exists for JRE projects if you're using the
'java-library' plugin. If you're using the regular 'java' plugin you only
get 'compile' and 'implementation' (the idea being you're a leaf node and
don't have anywhere to expose dependencies to).

So I worry that api won't exist for some people, and they'll be confused.
Does Gradle warn about compile in JRE projects like it does in Android projects?.jbduncan: @cpovirk Good point about @JakeWharton's comment!
Gradle does warn about compile in JRE projects too. :(
Taking all this into consideration, I think the best advice to give Gradle users is something like the following:

To add a dependency using Gradle:
// For Java applications or Java libraries which use Guava internally:
implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:25.1-jre'
// Or, for Java libraries which use the ""java-library"" plugin and expose Guava types to users
api 'com.google.guava:guava:25.1-jre'
// Or, for Android applications & libraries which use Guava internally:
implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:25.1-android'
// Or, for Android libraries which use the ""java-library"" plugin and expose Guava types to users
api 'com.google.guava:guava:25.1-android'

But having said this, the example advice I give above is quite verbose. I wonder if there's a better way of presenting it to Gradle&Guava users...",2018-05-23T21:03:18Z,2018-05-25T17:39:01Z,2,0,5

 Stop using ByteArrayOutputStream in ByteStreams.toByteArray methods.
They were using ByteStreams.copy to copy the source to the BAOS. This meant reading from the source into a buffer, then copying from that buffer to a different buffer in the BAOS. Additionally, the way BAOS operates is not great: whenever it needs more space, it creates a new array twice as large as the previous, copies all bytes from the previous array to the new one, and discards the previous array.
Instead, read directly from the source into a sequence of buffers. When a buffer fills up, don't discard it, but instead create a new, twice as large, buffer and start reading into it.

 Make ByteSource.read() use sizeIfKnown(), if available, to help avoid extra byte array allocations/copies.
Also don't use 32 as the initial ByteArrayOutputStream size in either version of ByteStreams.toByteArray(); just seems way too small. Use the default size for buffers instead, at a minimum.
Also change ConcatenatedByteSource.sizeIfKnown() to return absent if its Iterable of sources is not a Collection; this is to prevent sizeIfKnown() trying to loop over an infinite Iterable, which previous caused an infinite loop. That is also fixed in this CL; ConcatenatedByteSource.size() and sizeIfKnown() now stop and return Long.MAX_VALUE if the result would exceed that rather than going negative and continuing. But looping over an infinite Iterable in sizeIfKnown() seems potentially slow even if it will eventually stop, and as such against the spirit of sizeIfKnown(), which should be fast.

 Set serialVersionUID in TypeToken.java
RELNOTES=Add a serialVersionUID to TypeToken
dc8ef1a.jbduncan: I question the reasoning behind this change. What if, for example, a user passed in a Vavr collection, where AFAICT none of them implement java.util.Collection?
...Although, having said this, I think that all Vavr collections have an asJava() O(1) view method that returns an appropriate java.util.Collection, so maybe this isn't such a big problem?.cgdecker: Yeah, this does prevent you from getting a known size with some things that it would actually be fine to iterate over. I was actually considering just getting rid of this sizeIfKnown() implementation because iterating over an unknown number of component sources to get the size seems somewhat dubious for something that's supposed to get you the size if it's quickly available. Sure, this doesn't need to read all the streams, but still.
I'm still not sure what I want to do about this... one thing I was considering was changing slice()'s sizeIfKnown() to have a special case for when it's a slice of a concatenated source, where rather than trying to get the whole sizeIfKnown() of the concatenated source, it just iterates over its component sources until it knows whether or not the concatenated source is big enough to encompass the full slice. But I decided I'd spent enough time on the issue and did this as a compromise..jbduncan: Ah okay. I see now that this is more complicated than I thought at first, and I understand that you've put a lot of thought into things and that you came to this compromise after spending a lot of time already on it.
I admit that I still don't see the link between SlicedByteSource.sizeIfAbsent()'s implementation and returning Optional.absent() here early if the sources are just a plain Iterable. Would you kindly go into more detail about that for me?.cgdecker: So, slice() allows the slice you specify to start at any offset and have any length, because you don't know the size of the underlying source without reading it, as a rule. So when you want to get the sizeIfKnown() of the SlicedByteSource, you can't just say it's the length of the slice. It's really either the length OR the number of bytes there are between the offset and the end of the underlying source, whichever is smaller. So, you need to know the sizeIfKnown() of the underlying source to get the sizeIfKnown() of the slice.
And with this change, calling read() always at least asks for the sizeIfKnown(), on the assumption that it either won't get it and will read like normal or that it will get it quickly and maybe perform a little better.
So what happened (a test caught this) was:
ByteSource source = ByteSource.concat(Iterables.cycle(sources)).slice(offset, length);
byte[] b = source.read(); // loops forever in ConcatenatedByteSource.sizeIfKnown()
Now, changing ConcatenatedByteSource.sizeIfKnown() to stop looping once it hits Long.MAX_VALUE fixes it looping forever, but if the individual sources are, say, 4 bytes each, you're still calling sizeIfKnown() on them something like 2.3 quintillion times before you get there. Admittedly A) infinite iterables are a perverse case here, and B) this is an extreme example, but you get the picture. Basically, if sizeIfKnown() isn't relatively fast, it's probably better not to use it.
But of course, a Collection could have millions of elements, and a non-Collection could have 1. So it's hard to say how the line should be drawn. But then again, it probably doesn't matter too terribly much: ByteSource.concat() doesn't have a huge number of usages, and I'd be willing to bet that for the vast majority of them, the Iterable is both a Collection and has 4 or fewer elements.",2018-03-20T20:38:29Z,None,3,13,4

I think it will be good if you guys do something with it..jbduncan: @liweys I can't speak for the Guava team, but I can think of two reasons why short-hand methods for System.out::println do not add enough value to meet Guava's ""utility times ubiquity"" bar:


IDEs (or IntelliJ IDEA, at least) have code completion function(s) which allow System.out.println(...) to be typed easily. For example, if you type sout in IntelliJ IDEA and hit Enter, it will automatically expand to System.out.println().
Thus, providing short-hand functions would probably not save any time in writing and especially reading of code (the most important of the two), as most if not every Java programmer already understands System.out::println.


We are in a time where a lot of Java applications are server-side and web applications, where loggers are a lot more useful that ""println"" statements (as messages written to loggers can be redirected to logs and then interrogated later for debugging purposes).

Do not check for equality using ==. Use equals instead. It's possible to construct BigInteger equal to BigInteger.ZERO but¬†not being the same instance as BigInteger.ZERO. One of many possibilities is to call new BigInteger(0, new byte[0]).
First divide, then multiply. It's more efficient. As rounding is indeed UNNECESSARY, don't use it at all (it is sufficient to use BigInteger.divide).
There's no need to call abs() more than once.

public static BigInteger lcm(BigInteger a, BigInteger b) {
	if (a.equals(BigInteger.ZERO) || b.equals(BigInteger.ZERO)) {
		return BigInteger.ZERO;
	}
	BigInteger gcd = a.gcd(b);
	return a.divide(gcd).multiply(b).abs();
}.srinivascodes: @perceptron8 Thanks for your valuable advice. Changed my code's implementation.
By the way, why do you suspect that this PR won't be merged? Is it because, there is no requirement of lcm method or is it like the implementation is not good enough?.jbduncan: @srinivascodes I can't speak for @perceptron8, but I suspect that from reading this comment from one of the Guava team members, and also from what I personally know of the Guava team, that they will want to go through their rigorous internal API review process first, which would probably mean that you'd need to reimplement your efforts from scratch by the time they're ready to give feedback, if they haven't already gone and implemented it themselves inside Google.
It's for that reason that they suggest in their contribution guidelines that people who want new APIs should raise an issue first and that code should come afterwards. :).jbduncan: I hope that this sheds some light on things for you. ;).perceptron8: @srinivascodes My intuition was based mostly on contribution guidelines that @jbduncan mentioned.

 Change all instances of encoded.subSequence() to use a simple start index offset, which reduces the Java memory footprint for TrieParser by at at least 130 MBs.

This memory enhancement was found while investigating flakiness issues for some tests which had the same root cause of: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded, mostly in the TrieParser class.

Thanks for making your project Open Source! Any feedback is greatly appreciated..netdpb: CodeTriage seems like a really valuable resource, but especially for projects that have a high frequency of incoming bugs that are relatively easy to triage by people who are not part of the core team. Most of our issues are not bug reports or user questions, but rather design proposals or feature requests. And many of them may be reasonable requests but don't fit into what we want to maintain as part of Guava. We have started to triage our bugs more actively (sadly, we were not doing a great job for a while), but it's hard for us to see how adding people who are not deeply involved with our design process will help.
I'll close this PR for now, but we'd be interested in hearing more from you about how we might be able to use this service..schneems: I guess it's a question of how you want to acquire new regular contributors, and what exactly you want them to help you with once they're on board.
I used this service to get commit on Rails and while I did a good amount of bug triaging, I also followed saw common themes and questions come up and common answers be delivered that I eventually felt comfortable to proactively suggest when an idea wasn't a good fit.

You've already got a pretty healthy following at 164 subscribers. These are people who have indicated that they're interested in helping out in some capacity on this project even if issue triage isn't the best fit.
I would be interested to hear from you, as a maintainer, what kinds of things you want help with?.jbduncan: @schneems Were you able to get a hold of one of the Guava maintainers privately or offline to discuss this further? I'm subscribed to Triage's Guava feed, so if there is a way that contributors such as myself could better contribute to Guava, I'd love to hear more. :).kevinb9n: The difficulty here is that we don't actually need much help with implementation. What we need is more quality bug reports, and quality feature requests, that are highly persuasive. We need to understand not just what feature could be added, but how we can be sure that it is broadly useful, and why it leads to people writing better code than they have to today. There's no badge you can add for that..kevinb9n: To be clear, I am grateful for this suggestion. And I do feel very sad that Guava is so hard to contribute usefully to from the outside. As things stand, though, I agree with @netdpb that this badge won't help matters..jbduncan: @kevinb9n Ah okay. It is sad that that's the case, but it confirms what I knew deep down, so thank you anyway. :).schneems: If you open an issue that says what you want and what the project needs then it will eventually get in the hands of all subscribers.
Maybe there‚Äôs a better fit I could add for the product later, but that‚Äôs the only outreach method that would be usable today.",2018-02-18T19:12:34Z,2018-02-26T21:24:32Z,1,1,6

As for the immutable types: They're this way because, in 2008:

Add the ""? super"" make you need a ""."" in this line:
SortedSet<String> set = ImmutableSortedSet.<String>orderedBy(STRING_LENGTH).of(
    ""in"", ""the"", ""quick"", ""jumped"", ""over"", ""a"");

If the types are the same, that generic parameter isn't needed.

POC: replace explicit null checks by automatic,cla: yes,liach,,"denis-zhdanov: This PR illustrates an approach where explicit null-checks are replaced by automatic checks.
Consider a sample class - Iterators:
Original source code
public static <T> Iterator<T> concat(Iterator<? extends T> a, Iterator<? extends T> b) {
  checkNotNull(a);
  checkNotNull(b);
  return concat(consumingForArray(a, b));
}
Suggested source code
public static <T> Iterator<T> concat(Iterator<? extends T> a, Iterator<? extends T> b) {
  return concat(consumingForArray(a, b));
}
Resulting bytecode looks like if it's compiled from the source below:
public static <T> Iterator<T> concat(Iterator<? extends T> a, Iterator<? extends T> b) {
  if (a == null) {
    throw new NullPointerException(""a was null"");
  }
  if (b == null) {
    throw new NullPointerException(""b was null"");
  }
  return concat(consumingForArray(new Iterator[] { a, b }));
}
Raw bytecode
javap -c ./guava/target/classes/com/google/common/collect/Iterators.class

  public static <T> java.util.Iterator<T> concat(java.util.Iterator<? extends T>, java.util.Iterator<? extends T>);

Implementation
The checks are generated by the Traute javac plugin - it finds existing package-level ParametersAreNonnullByDefault annotation and adds checks for all method parameters not marked by Nullable annotation (Checker's NullableDecl is supported by default).
Restrictions
Traute is a javac plugin and corresponding API is available since java8. Do you guys use something like javac8 -source 1.7 -target 1.7 for generating javac7 bytecode?
Proposal
I'd be glad to create a PR/modify current PR which replaces all explicit null-checks if the team likes the approach..lowasser: I'm not sure we would want this?  Historically we have resisted ""silently generated"" code -- e.g. this is why we favor AutoValue over Lombok -- and strongly prefer code to be explicit and traceable..denis-zhdanov: @lowasser, thanks for the feedback!
My assumption was that preserving existing contracts (implied by ParametersAreNonnullByDefault) and making the code more clear by removing explicit checks might be good for the project.
Regarding the traceability - exceptions thrown from the failed generated checks reference corresponding parameter line. Also exception message makes it clear what wrong has happened",2017-12-24T07:20:49Z,2018-01-24T17:37:05Z,6,14,5

    Fix Types.toString for arrays

So, I skipped one letter ""n"" and so the emails don't match.
Thank you again..googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!.cpovirk: Thanks for noticing this. I believe the bug is in the docs, as I think our goal is to match the JDK's behavior. Primary TypeToken author @fluentfuture would know..MaridProject: Curiously, the method Types.toString(Type) (with package-private modifier) has javadocs but TypeToken.toString() (with public modifier) doesn't. Nonetheless, I feel that the first sentence Returns human readable string representation of {@code type}. is what you wanted since the beginning (by intent). [Ljava.lang.String; could not be considered as a ""human readable string"", it's just a string representation..cpovirk: I do believe that String[] is nicer in a vacuum, but I think that we're trying to exactly match the JDK's strings. We go to some effort to do that, even across JDK versions (e.g., here)..cpovirk: I do think I was too quick to dismiss the behavior change: I had been thinking that the problem was our implementations of Type.toString(), where we'd like to match the JDK, but of course you're talking about TypeToken.toString(), where we're freer to do what we want. (That said, it's possible that someone depends on the current behavior. We'd still be within our rights to change it, but we'd have to weigh the risks.) Sorry about that.
And now I've been starting at this for 30 minutes, and I'm pretty confused. It looks like we mostly use JavaVersion.CURRENT.typeName(Type), but we sometimes use Types.toString(Type) instead. And those two look to be intended to mostly match. They're probably intended to be different in some cases, but I suspect we're not using them all in exactly the right places -- one consequence of which is that we might be using [Ljava.lang.String; and java.lang.String[] in the wrong places. As noted above, it's one thing for TypeToken to have its own toString format, but we'd like our Type implementations to match the JDK's. But I'm not sure whether we're accomplishing that, either. (Certainly our tests for toString() are sparse.)
There's probably something better that could be done here, distinguishing between methods used in toString() and methods used in getTypeName() and then changing TypeToken to rely solely on getTypeName(). (But it's more complicated than that because we'd want identical behavior in the backport, where we can't rely on getTypeName().) I assume that it's possible to do this, but it's likely to be a larger change, requiring testing on various JDK versions to account for the quirks of each..fluentfuture: Yeah. We went through quite some work to keep our Type#toString() consistent with JDK's native Type implementations.
In a nutshell, Guava's toString() has been always delegating to the underlying Type's toString() or getName() without doing any stunt on our part.
For non-Class Type, this has been pretty human readable because JDK's toString() has been pretty human readable (and we keep Guava's Type#toString() consistent with JDK's); for non-Array Class, this has also been pretty readable cause JDK's getName() has been pretty readable.
Unfortunately array Class before Java 8 didn't offer a method that returned human readable string. We could have tried to build a human readable string but then it'd add yet another condition where we differ from the JDK's implementation.
I share Chris's concern about backward compatibility regarding relying on Java 8's getTypeName().
If we must, perhaps adding a new TypeToken#getTypeName() method would be a more backward-compatible change although we need to make sure it carries its own weight compared to the user code simply calling typeToken.getType().getTypeName() in Java 8 code..cpovirk: If there are cases in which our Type.toString() implementations differ from the JDK's, we'd ideally fix that. It's also possible that we could modify TypeToken.toString() specifically to behave more like Type.getTypeName(). Additionally, could make sure our Type.getTypeName() implementations match the JDK implementations. (Maybe they already do.) But these are larger questions than the documentation, which is at least no longer incorrect.",2017-11-11T16:28:01Z,2018-01-29T16:42:04Z,1,0,6
Modifying Quantiles to return ordered HashMap,cla: yes package=math status=fixed,cgdecker,cgdecker,"hshankar: Usually, when someone computes percentiles, they would end up iterating over the resulting map to print the percentiles or store them somewhere. It is useful to return the percentiles in the order in which they were requested.
e.g,
If one computes Quantiles.percentiles().indexes(50, 90, 99).compute(times) and iterates over the result, it should be iterated in the order 50, 90, 99. Currently, we use HashMap, so the order is unpredictable. Making it a LinkedHashMap will ensure results in the expected order with very minimal perf impact..googlebot: Thanks for your pull request.

In order to pass this check, please resolve this problem and have the pull request author add another comment and the bot will run again..googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!.hshankar: Makes sense. Updated the docs and added a test. One thing to note is, since the indexes are de-duped, if the same index is repeated, the order of the result will only contain the first instance. e.g, if indexes are 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, the results will be in order 0, 1, 2, 3. I think this should be ok though, since it doesn't change the existing behavior guarantees..PeteGillin: This looks like a sensible approach to me. (I think @cgdecker is doing the actual review.)
Aside: It's a shame we can't use ImmutableMap here, of course, but c.g.common.math can't depend on c.g.common.collect without creating a circular dependency :-(..ronshapiro: @cgdecker Is this ready to submitted internally?.cpovirk: I don't see an internal review, though I could be missing it.
A question to anyone still following along here: Would it make sense to instead sort the indexes? That wouldn't make a difference for (50, 90, 99), of course, but maybe users would want sorted order in most cases? (We could even return a NavigableMap, though we might not bother to change the declared return type at this point.) I suspect that a TreeMap may be a little slower to iterate than a LinkedHashMap, but the difference is likely noise. I'm not sure how the two compare in size..cgdecker: By and large I've totally missed when things have been assigned to me on GitHub like this, so no, there wasn't any internal review.
I'm not clear enough about the use cases/user's expectations to know whether sorting making sense, though to hazard a guess I'd say it probably makes sense. Of course, the user can always copy the result to a TreeMap if that's what they want; preserving the initial order is slightly harder, though still possible, by creating a LinkedHashMap manually and putting each key in the initial order and its value from the returned Map into that..PeteGillin: If we do user-specified-order, as @hshankar originally suggested, and the user wanted sorted, then the user has another option: specify the indexes in sorted order. I just spot-checked about a dozen callers in our codebase, and most of them were hard-coding the indexes, so putting in order would be trivial (and the ones who weren't hard-coding them were generating them in order anyway).
That seems like another argument for preferring user-specified-order, on top of the one that @cgdecker mentions (that converting to a TreeMap is easier than vice versa).
In practice, all of the callers I spot-checked in our codebase were already specifying the indexes in order, so it wouldn't make any difference to them which we chose (and both would be more predictable than the current behaviour).",2017-11-09T22:38:10Z,2019-10-02T17:48:45Z,1,0,7

Throwables#lazyStackTrace unsupported on IBM JDK 6,cla: yes,,,"fdesu: Fix addresses a problem occurred on IBM JDK 6. To ensure
that we can call underlying method, Throwables#getSizeMethod,

further usage.
Issue: #2887.fdesu: For the sake of clarification: there were two obvious ways:

Guard a call to JavaLangAccess#getStackSize inside AbstractList#size in Throwables#jlaStackTrace with try-catch
Make a dry call of JavaLangAccess#getStackSize and if it success, then assume, that it is safe to call it

Fix #2914 by switching -android version suffix to -ga; revert vanilla‚Ä?cla: yes,,ronshapiro,"yborovikov: This patch changes -android version suffix to -ga for Android / Java 7 flavored version of Guava, resolving #2914.
The resolution piggy-backs on documented Maven ComparableVersion feature that equates ga-suffixed versions (e.g. 24.0-ga) with non-suffixed ones (e.g. 24.0) in the context of comparing / ordering / determining the latest version.
Note: This also reverts the patch by @cpovirk, restoring the original vanilla (Java 8+) Guava versioning scheme (e.g. from patched 24.0-jre back to 24.0).
Note: README.md text should be updated before releasing the next version to reflect the suffix change for the Android version..ooxi: I have read the issue linked. Nevertheless I think using -ga instead of -android will lead to a lot of confusion. Without having seen this pull request I would not have known the difference between 24.0 and 24.0-ga and would most likely have picked 24.0-ga when updating (since general availability seems better than no suffix)..yborovikov: @ooxi You'd have every right to get confused initially (even though such mistake would usually get immediately realized at your project compile time) - what Guava is trying to achieve with releasing both android/java7 and java8+ artifacts is indeed confusing. Arguably, they do have a reason for doing this, though.
As to GA version being considered ""better"" than plain (non-suffixed) release one - I'm not sure it's clear cut (and might be highly subjective, depending on one's history of exposure to these). When I encounter such versions I try to check the project documentation on their versioning scheme and semantics.
Wikipedia's Software release life cycle article has this diagram:

which probably (yet not necessarily) reflects some majority opinion / consensus on the topic.
Anyway, in case of a doubt a quick glance at Guava project landing page should clear any confusion and make the choice between vanilla and android/java7-specific version reasonably obvious..ooxi: Thank you for such an in-depth explanation of your reasoning. While I still would have been confused and would likely have chosen the wrong version at first, you are right in your estimation that it would have been more logical to use 24.0 than 24.0-ga. I therefore withdraw my initial rejection of this change..cgdecker: I'm not clear on how -ga makes sense. ""General availability"" isn't a term we use in Guava releases and really doesn't have any particular relevance to ""Android flavor"". The scheme we've chosen is <version>-jre and <version>-android for the two flavors of Guava, and that's what we'll be going with barring significant evidence that we should be doing something different.",2017-09-19T20:26:58Z,2017-09-28T19:13:03Z,1,0,6,

LocalCache.asMap().compute(...) deadlocks if its lambda throws an exception,cla: yes package=cache,lowasser,lowasser,"mmimica: LocalCache.asMap().compute(...) deadlocks if its lambda throws an exception. Demonstrated by the test. Fixed by properly handling the exception and realising the lock..ben-manes: Also see #2799..mmimica: Oh I see, a duplicate. Well, I think my fix is better because it localizes changes in LoadingValueReference where the actual problem is. An exception is kind of function's legitimate result, which should be caught there and set as a result.
Also there is a test. It could be written better. For some reason I cannot get @Test(expected = RuntimeException.class) to work..ben-manes: Does this remove the loading value? I don't think it does from a glance..mmimica: It doesn't. It assumes the rest of the code works as expected. I didn't manage to reproduce any problems. Even the test from the other PR passes.
But I'm not familiar with the inner workings of LocalCache..ben-manes: From looking at the Map.compute implementation, I think it doesn't handle the exception being thrown. Instead the entry is stuck and a subsequent compute replaces it because of the lines previous to your change regarding the previous. It is then stuck with a LoadingValueReference, which works as expected because a getIfPresent will read from the oldValue. But likely a LoadingCache.get will be stuck thinking there is a computing entry and that the loader will do the cleanup (getAndRecordStats vs waitForLoadingValue).
Ideally after a test case an internal integrity check would be run to find these conditions. Then any invisible or hard to query cases would be caught. I think CacheTesting.checkEmpty would do that here due to keySet likely having 1 entry. The checkValidState doesn't verify that all entries are fully loaded, so it wouldn't catch it.",2017-08-09T19:21:06Z,2018-05-23T17:40:04Z,2,0,5

And to come back to your original concern: those types do return Iterable<? extends N>..findepi: @lowasser , good point, thanks, but it just doesn't look that good.
@jrtom , this is even better since signature <T> preOrder(T x, Function<T, ? extends Iterable<? extends T>>) will compile nicely with method references. TreeTraversal.using(func) can't be made to work with method references in the ""relaxed"" case unless explicit type for method generic is provided.
That said, is there going to be  preOrder() operating on SuccessorsFunction-s? I looked into sources, but couldn't find anything besides the interface declaration.
Last but not least, does the probable retirement of TreeTraverser say anything in regards on this PR? :).jrtom: Yes, there are going to be various traversal options including preorder.  Wouldn't be much of a replacement otherwise.  :) The details are still pending review but there should be something soon, probably in a few weeks.
The fact that TreeTraverser is expected to be replaced suggests to me that we're unlikely to change it at this point, but that's not my call.

Add an Automatic-Module-Name manifest entry,cla: yes,,,"eljobe: This is recommended for any java library which is being published to
repositories like MavenCentral or JCenter to ensure that when you do
eventually convert the library to a Java 9 module, it won't change
names requiring all of your consumers and the projects which depend
upon your consumers to update their moudle-info.java files to
pick up the new name.
We can debate whether or not com.google.guava is the name you want
to adopt for your module. Other possible candidates are:

guava
google.guava
com.google.common.guava
Something else

This article covers
a lot of the reasons you might want to use com.google.guava, but I have also read reasonable arguments for more concise names if you aren't worried about module name conflicts.
Related (a little bit) to #2571.Stephan202: @jodastephen, the author of that article, actually strongly suggests using com.google.common..eljobe: @Stephan202 you are right. I am happy to change the module name in the pull request to com.google.common if the Guava project owns that entire package namespace. I was under the (quite possibly wrong) impression that other libraries provided by other teams at Google might also contribute to that package namespace, and as such, thought that we should coordinate with other libraries/modules that provided subpackages of com.google.common by naming this module com.google.common.guava. I agree that it would be better to use the root package of the whole package hierarchy.
But, first I would like someone to be able to confidently confirm, ""No other jar files inside or outside Google contribute classes to the com.google.commons package. It is entirely dedicated to the guava project.""
If that's the case, I'll update the pull request on getting that confirmation..cpovirk: We do release other things under com.google.common, but in the discussion linked by @Stephan202, we're told that's not a problem for using that module name..eljobe: It's true. As long as you're willing to claim that the package root com.google.common is owned by the guava team, it's a fine choice. I've updated the pull request to match..jbduncan: @cpovirk Does the Guava project wholly own the com.google.common package and it's sub-packages, both externally on GitHub and internally within Google?
@eljobe If the Guava project does not wholly own com.google.common and/or it's sub-packages, will this be a problem?.jbduncan: Hmm, after re-reading this conversation, I understand now that only the com.google.common package needs to be owned by the Guava team?
On the assumption that my new understanding is correct, I'll rephrase my previous questions:

Does the Guava project wholly own the com.google.common package (not necessarily it's sub-packages)?
If com.google.common isn't wholly owned by Guava, would this be a problem for migrating to modules?.eljobe: I think I may be introducing more confusion than clarity here, but it's worth writing about in a bit more detail because we really only want to make this decision once.
First of all, I think that Stephen makes a well-reasoned argument in his JPMS module naming post.
The point about com.google.common not being wholly ""owned"" by the Guava team is why I originally proposed that we deviate from Stephen's suggestion and go with com.google.guava instead of com.google.common. The scenario we want to avoid is this one in the future.
There is are 3 separate and mostly-independent teams inside Google each of which maintains a module which exports some packages in the com.google.common namespace. Let's call the teams (the people):
Guava Team
Blue Team
Red Team
Guava Team publishes a module which exports packages (reduced for space):

com.google.common.annotations
com.google.common.base
com.google.common.collect

Blue Team publishes a module which exports packages:

com.google.common.bonnet
com.google.common.bird
com.google.common.sky

Red Team publishes a module which exports packages:

com.google.common.head
com.google.common.hydrant
com.google.common.robin

Only one of those teams can call their module com.google.common. If the Guava Team takes that, then what will the Blue Team and Red Team use? I'm assuming here that we don't really want the package structure to reflect organizational structure. It should represent what the code in the packages actually does. So, we don't want to force rerooting packages like com.google.guava.common.base or com.google.blue.common.bird just to create artificial common prefixes we can use for the module names.
There isn't really a great answer here. Personally, I think that google.guava would be a fine name. And google.blue and google.red may eventually make sense for the other modules once they are written. Modules (like the jars in which they are packaged) typically are the natural responsibility of a team of people. Package names are about the organizational logic of the code, but module names can (and maybe even should) reflect the group that is responsible for the module's maintenance. Suppose the Guava project grows in such a way that it makes sense to deliver a separate module for all of the ""collect"" and ""base"" packages separate from all the other packages currently bundled in the library. Which of the modules retains the name ""com.google.common""?  I think it would make more sense at that point to announce to the community that the ""google.guava"" module is jettisoning the ""collect"" and ""base"" packages into a new ""google.guava.core"" or maybe ""google.guava-core"" or maybe even ""google.lychee"" module.
I actually think it might be better to separate the module names from the packages they contain because those concepts evolve through separate development lifecycles.
But, ultimately, I care less about the name you choose, than that you choose it before the 23.0 release, so we can get it published with this new manifest attribute. The choice is your's..jodastephen: Lets start by observing that Google (the company) owns everything under com.google. As such, it can choose to structure module names under there any way it wants, so long as there is a company-wide co-ordination to ensure that no package appears in two modules. This observation allows many choices for the module name however, and as such isn't that helpful.
(The observation is however that ALL Google modules should start with com.google, so I'd object strongly to google.guava as your module name).
The next observation is that the standard (Java-wide) rule for module names should be that the module name is the super-package name of the project. While this rule handles many cases, it does not of course handle the Guava case, as each package is a sibling.
In my blog, I describe this case, and argue that the implied super-package in a case like this is the next level up. Thus, I arrive at my view of com.google.common being the right package name for Guava. Doing so does not stop other teams using com.google.common.bird or com.google.common.head as module names if they need to.

Looking to the future, there is another way to view the whole problem space however. Each package in Guava is pretty isolated. There are dependencies between the packages, but they form a DAG as far as I can tell. As such, it would be perfectly possible for each package to be a separate module (where the module name is then obviously the package name).
Now, today this would be a pain to do, because it would mean publishing a separate artifact to Maven Central for each package, something that nobody would really want. However, there is a fair chance that Oracle will consider having multi-module jar files in a future release of Java (ie. one jar file containing many modules). Were this to happen, having a module for each package is suddenly not such a bad idea, as users could then depend on the subset of Guava they care about, or the whole of it, and not suffer any clashes.
In this scenario, the Guava module would then be an aggregating module that contains no bytecode of its own:
module ???? {
  requires transitive com.google.common.annotations;
  requires transitive com.google.common.base;
  requires transitive com.google.common.collect;
}

This is similar to the JDK, where the java.se module aggregates others. But note that there is no java.se package. ie. Aggregating modules can and will have names that differ from the packages, because they necessarily are aggregations of disconnected packages for the purpose of convenience.
Given this world view, com.google.guava is a viable module name, because the ""Guava"" project can be thought of as an aggregation of a set of unrelated packages Google chooses to publish publicly.
One final note however, if com.google.guava were chosen, Google the company would be committing to never having a package name of com.google.guava, as to do so would be asking for trouble.

So, either com.google.common or com.google.guava are reasonable choices derived through different thought processes. While I originally strongly recommended the former, the latter does now have appeal given the description above of internal teams also wanting to use the com.google.common module name.
Ultimately, the Guava team must decide as to which of the two world-views of the project describes it best - a single project formed of a coherent set of packages (com.google.common). Or an aggregation of relatively separate packages that could standalone, unified under a brand name (com.google.guava)..eljobe: What is the process by which the guava team can get this decision made?.kluever: As @kevinb9n said here,

Provisionally, the name com.google.common seems fine..cpovirk: @jodastephen's recommendation was simply to declare which module name we choose. (And I think we're all happy with com.google.common.) He hadn't recommended specifically to us that we set Automatic-Module-Name, but his later blog post sounds to me like it recommends the practice in general. Stephen -- just to check explicitly -- do you recommend that we set Automatic-Module-Name? Is there any downside, given that we're happy with com.google.common?.jodastephen: Now that JDK 9 looks like passing the official processes with no further changes, it is safe (and recommended) to add Automatic-Module-Name to Guava.
You'll keep declaring that until you write a proper module-info file, which won't be too hard to do once JDK 9 is finally released. (Maven has support for compiling module-info.java on JDK 9 and merging the .class file with the rest of the code so it all works on JDK 8)..cpovirk: Thanks.

I'm inclined to leave those lines because they do explain the difference between the methods and the equivalent non-""try"" method on Integer itself. It's true that the method doesn't throw if parsing fails, but parsing failing and the input being null are different things. I do see how it could be confusing, so I'm inclined to add explicit @throws NullPointerException to the Javadoc instead (even though that's not a thing we normally do). We've already done that in a similar cases, as pointed out in #1259.",2017-05-02T01:47:27Z,2019-10-02T20:54:45Z,1,0,3

Making the BloomFilter thread-safe & lock-free,cla: yes package=hash type=addition,"lowasser,ben-manes",lowasser,"Valloric: Previously, the BloomFilter wasn't thread-safe and required external locking to ensure safety. Now, it's thread-safe and lock-free through the use of atomics and compare-and-swap.
This PR introduces no API changes beyond an extra @ThreadSafe annotation on the BloomFilter class. It should also be entirely backwards (and forwards) compatible with the serialization format because that too isn't being changed.
Please extend extra scrutiny to the LockFreeBitArray.putAll() method because it's not present in our internal fork of the BloomFilter class and has thus not gone through our integ tests or has seen prod (I wrote it for this PR).
Fixes #2748..ben-manes: To strengthen your argument, you should probably add a benchmark to show the performance impact for reads and writes in a single threaded case. See Guava's Caliper benchmarks.
This approach is probably okay even though its leaks partial updates. That's mostly because there isn't clear() or resize() methods, requiring a new instance be created when overfilled. Otherwise a bloom-1 design would be required for correctness..Valloric: To strengthen your argument, you should probably add a benchmark to show the performance impact for reads and writes in a single threaded case. See Guava's Caliper benchmarks.

I have JMH benchmarks (see this email for Caliper vs JMH) set up for our internal fork which is largely the same except the serialization parts have been ripped out, other hash strategies have been added etc. Perf using the standard murmur3 strategy should be identical.
I can update that and post numbers. It's not ideal, but it's the best I have without going through the massive hassle of supporting JMH benchmarks for guava (I wouldn't trust Caliper)..Valloric: @ben-manes

As expected, the puts are slightly slower (about 20%) in the lock-free version. The read perf is the same because atomic reads are free on x86 (and x86-64). It's hard for me to imagine a realistic single-threaded use-case for a bloom filter; even then, since the read path is what almost always matters in a bloom filter and that sees no slowdown, I think a 20% hit on the single-threaded put path is acceptable..Valloric: @lowasser Any thoughts on this PR so far?.Valloric: @lowasser @ben-manes The latest code addresses all issues that have been brought up so far..Valloric: @lowasser @ben-manes
OK, benchmarks with the extra IF branch. Note that I'm including another set of benchmarks for the same code pairs, but the second set is with a much smaller bloom filter: 10k puts on a BF with 50k expected insertions vs the original 10k puts on a BF with 150M expected insertions. I added this to look at cases with more thread contention.

The results are the same with and without the extra IF. Should I add it then or not? I'm leaning ""no"" because it doesn't seem to be paying off. Personally I'm fine with either..Valloric: Also, the extra IF seems to be introducing extra variance in the multi-threaded runs, probably because of branch prediction failures.
It could also just be noise, but it's consistent across BF sizes..ben-manes: Note that you are using a uniform distribution. The if check would be helpful if the entry had already been added to avoid unnecessary CASes. A Zipf distribution (example) might show beneficial results..Valloric: @ben-manes That's convincing enough for me. Perf is flat on a uniform distribution and the difference in variance is likely to be noise, and even if it isn't, it probably doesn't matter.

I did another run of the benchmark with the same smaller BF config and the large variance from the previous run went away. So it's noise, making the IF a safe pick.

Introduce ImmutableMap#mergeMapsCollector,P4 cla: no package=collect platform=java8 type=addition,lowasser,lowasser,"numero-six: Introduce a Collector to ease merging of Maps with java stream API.
Given (random Maps implementations used to ensure collector is generic):
HashMap<String, Integer> foo = new LinkedHashMap<>();

NavigableMap<String, Integer> bar = new TreeMap<>();
bar.put(""three"", 3);

        .flatMap(Set::stream)

As this is a new API, it's going to have to go through a process and some internal review before we even start thinking about the code.  (There's some explanation of this here.)
As it stands, there's a few things we'd need to get together before we approved this feature:

Some research on how common the need for this API is, ideally including several different places in real existing code that this API would have been helpful.  (This will probably end up needing to be done by a Googler, just because we have a large, easily-searchable codebase.)
For each of those real uses, a discussion of whether or not this API is really the best way to help those users.  For this feature, I'd wonder why the maps were created separately in the first place?  Do people actually have an unbounded number of maps, or do they have a fixed number of maps that need to be combined?  For example, I'd tend to rewrite the example you gave to the stream-free new ImmutableMap.Builder<>().putAll(foo).putAll(bar).build(), which is very short and simple..numero-six: Hi,

For this feature, I'd wonder why the maps were created separately in the first place?

That is just for the example.

Do people actually have an unbounded number of maps, or do they have a fixed number of maps that need to be combined?

Of course, the actual purpose is for an unbounded number of maps. For a fixed number of maps, your code is better.
My cases are usually like the Map is generated by a Stream#map call. Let's take a new example (imperative/no-stream-style first):
ImmutableMap.Builder<MyKey, MyValue> allKnownValues = ImmutableMap.builder();
for (Foo foo : foos) {
    Bar bar = this.convertFooToBar(foo);
    ImmutableMap<MyKey, MyValue> mapForFoo = bar.getTheMap();
    allKnownValues.putAll(mapForFoo);
}
return allKnownValues.build();
With the stream API, should be:
return foos.stream()
        .map(this::convertFooToBar)
        .map(Bar::getTheMap) // gives the Stream<Map<MyKey, MyValue>>
        .map(Map::entrySet)
        .flatMap(Set::stream)
        .collect(ImmutableMap.toImmutableMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue));
With the suggested new API:
return foos.stream()
        .map(this::convertFooToBar)
        .map(Bar::getTheMap)
        .collect(ImmutableMap.mergeMapsCollector());
I think this kind of creating a Map by dynamically filling it with dynamically computed maps is frequent (hence, the ImmutableMap.Builder#putAll(Map)). I won't discuss the need for this API because I think Guava maintainers have a much better point of view/experience for that than mine. My experience is just that people will favor 1st code (imperative style) to 2nd code which is too verbose and quite cryptic for the non-stream-API-fluent-developer and I think the 3rd one is much more functional-style (ie: declarative about the expected result), but it's just based on nothing more than my day-to-day experience.
Also, maybe mergeMaps is not the suitable term but I'm not a native english-speaker) and a mergeOperator could be passed..cpovirk: Mass-closing PRs without an accepted CLA.

@cpovirk, I'm not sure if you're the right person to ask, but do you know what @bdworth should do next?.cpovirk: googlebot might not know what to do with the corporate CLA.

I just emailed a different group to see if that helps.

The documented behavior is that the generated Converters are serializable if the original converter is serializable, which is accomplished with the status quo: if the underlying Converter is Serializable the serialization will work, otherwise you will get an exception when serialization is attempted.
Marking these fields transient will cause a NullPointerException if the object is serialized and deserialized, even if the original object was serializable.  (If our tests pass with your change, that probably reflects a problem with the tests?).lowasser: Or, rather, to be specific: the converter, if serialized and deserialized while the fields are transient, will throw an NPE on an attempt to use them for conversions..None: Understood - if you're fine with this, let me close the pull request.

If you signed the CLA as a corporation, please let us know the company's name..jct-amzn: I signed it.  I should be covered by Amazon corporate CLA, though it's not appearing on my account for some reason..jbduncan: @jct-amzn I think @googlebot hasn't recognised that you've signed the CLA? By my understanding, once you type the message

I signed it!

then googlebot should automatically detect it (it's a GitHub service/bot, not a human user üòÉ) and it should tell you what you need to do next to change the red ""cla: no"" label into a green ""cla: yes"" label..jbduncan: These changes look good to me now, so I'm happy to hand things over to the Guava team now. :).jct-amzn: Thanks for your review jbduncan.  I know googlebot's a bot -- I think the gears are turning on the corporate CLA.
My google account doesn't show that I'm part of the correct corporate CLA, so I think there's some problem on the backend, in the way the dots are all connected (github email -> google group -> CLA signatory).
Anyway it's just some one-time bookkeeping and I'm working on resolving it..jct-amzn: I signed it!.jct-amzn: Ok, trying again.  Google CLA recognizes me now.
I signed it!.jct-amzn: checking back on the status of this.  the CLA verifier probably doesn't support private email addresses in the github account.
if the bot is using this app script to do the CLA check:
https://github.com/angular/google-cla-verifier-for-github/blob/master/cla-verifier.gs
then you can see that they're just pulling the ""fake"" email from the patch file:
https://github.com/angular/google-cla-verifier-for-github/blob/master/cla-verifier.gs#L210
so I think there is no way the bot can trace that back to my actual email address, which should be in their signatories spreadsheet..googlebot: Thanks for your pull request.

Did you read the API section of the contribution guidelines? :).teaey: @jbduncan I just read it.
This guide means that only Google employees can merge the codeÔº?jbduncan: @teaey That's correct.
It also means that Google employees have very high standards for the APIs they accept into Guava and follow a rigorous internal review process, so this PR may be rejected initially and they'll ask you to rewrite the code, or they may decide that the API doesn't really add anything and outright reject it.
But if either of those things do happen to you, try not to be discouraged, for it would actually be a very good thing as it would mean that Guava's API remains relatively easy to use and of high quality. :).liach: google doesn't really like additions.

https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/What%27s-new-in-Mockito-2
I have ran your test suite locally before and after this change and
did not discover any regressions nor test failures.
While this version is a release candidate, we are not planning
to introduce any changes for the final release. There might be
possible bug fixes included in the final release, but so far
we have not received any reports of regressions in our library.
Thank you for using Mockito and please let us know what you think!.mockitoguy: Please consider pushing :) Thanks for supporting OS community!!!.TimvdLippe: Thanks a lot for merging @cpovirk . We are really happy that a 850k test code base can safely upgrade to multiple minor + 1 major version of Mockito. This gives us a lot of confidence publishing this long-awaited major upgrade..mockitoguy: Thank you @cpovirk. It's very helpful!

Applied skeletal implementation to interface migration automated refactoring,cla: yes,,,"khatchad: This is a semantics-preserving refactoring that migrates existing method implementations in classes to the corresponding implemented interface methods as default methods. The tool does not add new code; it only rearranges existing code.
We have upgraded the compilation process to use Java 8 so that default methods can be used. However, we realize that this may not be acceptable. Still, any feedback you can supply would be helpful.

We are evaluating a research prototype automated refactoring Eclipse plug-in called Migrate Skeletal Implementation to Interface. We have applied the tool to your project in the hopes of receiving feedback.
The approach is very conservative. That may mean that not all changes that can be made were made. Please feel free to continue the refactoring manually if you wish.
We only migrated methods declared in abstract classes with the hopes of such methods being suitable default methods in corresponding interfaces.
The source code should be semantically equivalent to the original.

Fix HttpHeaders constants to be lowercase.,cla: yes package=net,,kluever,"swankjesse: HTTP/2 requires lowercase, and it's our collective future. Any code that cares
about the casing of headers is broken, so any code that breaks from this change
is destined to break when it's used with HTTP/2.
String.toLowerCase() and Ascii.toLowerCase() both have optimizations that make
code run faster if the input is already lowercase. I estimate that 0.0000001%
of Google's extensive compute resources are currently wasted converting headers
to lowercase when they could be lowercase already..kluever: Oh man, I think this is going to cause some serious breakages inside of google if we merge it. This is pretty scary.

HTTP/2 requires lowercase

Can you send a reference to the RFC or whatever? I'm going to start an internal thread about this and see what folks think..kluever: Ahh, I think I found it:

header field names MUST be converted to lowercase prior to their encoding in HTTP/2. A request or response containing uppercase header field names MUST be treated as malformed

https://httpwg.github.io/specs/rfc7540.html#rfc.section.8.1.2.kluever: Hey Jesse,
We discussed this internally quite a bit, and decided to leave it as is.

The fact that HTTP headers are lowercase on the wire is an implementation detail. It does not need to be surfaced to users.

And...

The HTTP/2 protocol is mostly binary, so you'd be using an encoder anyway.

Yes, there is a slight performance penalty for lowercasing, but it's not even close to large enough for us to try to push a change of this magnitude through.
Cheers,
-kak.swankjesse: Works for me. Two quick notes about why this is too bad:

Any code that cares about case sensitivity here is almost certainly incorrect. Until recently this was academic. But any header that travels through an HTTP/2 channel comes out the other end in lowercase. ‚ÄùPushing a change of this magnitude through‚Ä?is fixing buggy code.
Because HTTP/2 exists, attempting to preserve case in HTTP headers is now a waste of code and CPU cycles. For example we use slow awkward TreeMaps with case-insensitive comparators rather than fast convenient LinkedHashMaps with lowercase keys.",2016-07-06T14:05:38Z,2016-07-20T17:47:15Z,1,0,3

Make Cache class keys type safe,cla: yes status=working-as-intended,,,"juhovh: Maybe this should be an issue instead of pull request, if you find this to be against the guidelines for contributing, please feel free to close this request immediately. I wanted to send a pull request instead to demonstrate how invasive the change would be. (not very)
Basically I was using LoadingCache<String, Value> in my application and used it to cache data based on a string key, and I also needed to invalidate the cache, so invalidate(key) was called whenever necessary. Later on I needed to change the type of the LoadingCache to LoadingCache<Wrapper, Value> in order to pass on some extra parameters for the CacheLoader. Everything compiled and seemed to work fine, but after a while some cache invalidation issues started to come up.
After debugging I figured out that the signature of invalidate(key) is actually invalidate(Object key), instead of using the actual key type. The lack of cache invalidation in turn caused inconsistency in our actual data and at least a day of extra work trying to fix everything manually. So I thought if having the key type included in the signature could've saved me hours of work, maybe I'm not the only one.

We do want to extend Error Prone to catch bugs not just with the use of JDK collections but also with Cache, but we haven't gotten there yet. Our hope is to do so by introducing some kind of @TypeCompatibleWith annotation. If we do that, then IntelliJ could read the annotation and provide the same warning. (Or they could just special-case Cache today.).kevinb9n: We are hoping to extend that Error Prone check to catch Guava classes like
Cache, but actually FindBugs has beaten us to that by a few years. I would
suggest adopting it in your project. It's unfortunate, but static analysis
is the only real solution here.

Preconditions was never designed with the notion that ""if you ever have
to revert to an if/throw something has gone terribly wrong"".
When I see circuitous things like this being done, I feel (more) sad that
we ever introduced Preconditions at all.

If you signed the CLA as a corporation, please let us know the company's name..ColinChartier: CLA done.googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!.ColinChartier: Hmm, looks like there is something strange about the way manifests are parsed versus how ClassLoader paths are parsed.
I've applied the fix only to the getClassPathEntries method, even though it seems the fix would apply both there and the getClassPathFromManifest method.
@eamonnmcmanus.eamonnmcmanus: Good find! But the previous method has new File(url.getFile()) too. Also, we should probably concoct a regression test?.ColinChartier: I discussed that in my PR, see google#2441.
Regarding the regression test, I'm not ready to make any opinions there. I've only started looking through the Guava code and how things are done around here today..ColinChartier: I think there is an issue in the getClassPathEntry method, the ""path"" argument should be URLEncoded before it is passed into the URL constructor, otherwise you get some really sketchy behavior like the URL being ""file:(...)/guava/guava-tests/base/the^file.jar"", and calling .toURI() on that throws an exception because it isn't a valid URL.
In any case, that seems like a separate issue, so I would rather do another PR for it.  I have to read up on what constitutes a valid manifest file entry to make sure that all of the encoding problems are solved there too.
This is one of those rare cases where the implementation was wrong in two places so that the unit test that should've caught this failed.  If the original method had been using the File(URI) constructor, it would've complained about the invalid URI being generated in the getClassPathEntry method.  If the getClassPathEntry method properly encoded the URI for special characters, the File(String) constructor would fail because it doesn't decode anything.  They both cancelled each other out to cause this weird little bug..eamonnmcmanus: Making a regression test isn't trivial because ClassPathTest doesn't currently have a simple way to obtain sample jars, as far as I can see. We would want a test that would put the jar in something like ""strange %directory""/test.jar but we'd need an input jar to put there. So it might not be feasible right now to make a test. (There's an additional layer of complexity because the test also has to work when run from Google's internal build system.).ColinChartier: In the mean time, is it possible to merge just this fix for the non-classpath loader? It shouldn't break any backwards compatibility, and we can fix file names with special characters here at least..cpovirk: We ended up attempting what I think is this with a fallback:
896c51a
We added some tests to create actual jars to test against. If you know of cases that still fail, let us know.",2016-04-01T01:30:54Z,2017-01-30T20:01:39Z,1,0,4

That's fine, but I don't think it belongs in Guava itself.
The way I look at it is that it changes every paragraph in the documentation. Since you're adding a new method, not changing behavior, that's in some sense OK. But I think the change is too large even for an overload, and I think the operation is too niche to justify adding a separate name for.

What do we do in case of timedWait methods-  return on interrupt? or keep retrying till timeout? Or take a supplier to check and retry?
Returning on interrupt will mean that the client might need to implement code to retry with reduced time which will essentially render the API pointless
Not returning on interrupt will mean that in some cases, the method will wait more than required
Taking a supplier as parameter is not preferred as discussed above.

Looks like Object.wait() is not a good candidate for uninterruptibility.",2016-02-07T08:20:17Z,2016-05-15T05:02:47Z,1,2,3

Usually we're able to strip out that stuff, but since it's being constructed in a static block, it's a little more difficult. Since it's not hurting anything, I'm inclined to leave it as-is..leeca: You have write permission, so it is your call.  But it does seem to violate the normal Googley convention that no dead or commented out code should be checked into the repository.  I guess all rules have exceptions..lowasser: To be clear, the code is used internally, and we mirror out our internal codebase by passing it through a stripping tool, which has more trouble stripping out this code than usual because of the way it's written.  Internally, we're extremely aggressive about stripping out unused code -- much more aggressive than we can be externally -- but this happens to hit an edge case where we can't strip out something that we've eliminated externally.",2015-12-28T19:22:30Z,2015-12-28T23:34:09Z,1,1,4

Update documentation to clarify that empty immutable collections may be singletons,P3 cla: yes package=collect type=documentation,,,"cjosw: This updates the documentation (no functional changes), to clarify that empty immutable collections may be singletons, as raised in a bug: #2083.nick-someone: Hi there! Sorry it's taken a while to get to reviewing this PR.
Looking over the changes, I have a couple of primary notes:

The ""implementations of this method"" language doesn't seem to make sense for static methods that have one implementation (while they follow the notes on Collections.emptyList(), etc.). I might suggest:

Performance notes: This method will always return the same instance of {@link FooType}.


If we continue along this line, please update the linked data type to the Immutable version (e.g.: ImmutableList as opposed to List). We prefer to keep the Immutable type as the interface (see #2083 (comment))",2015-12-07T16:53:03Z,2020-05-07T13:51:21Z,1,0,4
ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf should fail if input is not Comparable,cla: yes,,,"cjosw: ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf(Collection) should fail if the input collection is not comparable.
This currently applies for most collections, but fails if the input is a singleton.
This is recorded in issue #1835.
I have noted that this is caught within TreeSet by invoking the comparator on the singleton item, so this change makes a similar call to catch the un-comparable items in a singleton ImmutableSortedSet.
I have added tests for a two-element input collection (which was already caught), and a new test for a single-element input; this latter test only passes once the code change has been inserted..cpovirk: Thanks. The trick will be seeing if any existing Google code fails and needs to be fixed. I have a feeling that we tried this before and had problems, but I'm hoping for the best. I'll let you know how it goes..cpovirk: Actually, I went and found the CL from last year. It does break people. This includes some people who define Comparators that throw if given equal elements! That's terrible, but it's also hard to prioritize fixing. I've teased the project to a couple people without success.
Sorry for not putting this information in the bug report. I'll do so now..cjosw: This includes some people who define Comparators that throw if given equal elements!
Note (just for info) that this is exactly what TreeSet does when you insert its first element.
The comparator call is what triggers the failure here:
 SortedSet<Object> sortedSet = new TreeSet<Object>();
 sortedSet.add(notComparable);.cpovirk: Closing, since we need to do cleanup internally to take this :(",2015-12-04T13:02:41Z,2017-01-30T20:21:41Z,1,2,3

This isn't one of them.
Thanks to 63360f3, we are no longer putting these ""unimportant"" sources in Github. In fact, the specific source touched here was deleted in that CL.
Background: Our GWT setup in Guava was weird: Some of the GWT files were autogenerated from the ""server"" sources, and others were manually written. But the autogeneration happened internally before we push our code to Github, so it was tricky to tell which is which. Nowadays, we don't do the autogeneration, so I think that the only GWT code left is ""important"" GWT code (well, aside from the *_gwt.java test files)..cpovirk: @lowasser , aside from the GWT question, did you end up reviewing this?.lowasser: I don't think I did.

Remove old method from ImmutableList,cla: yes,,,"Vladlis: No description provided..cpovirk: readObject is a method automatically invoked during deserialization, so it's still ""used.""
But this is a weird case: Because ImmutableList has a serialization proxy, readObject should never be called. The only case in which it can be called is the case in which a malicious user imitates a serialized ImmutableList that doesn't use the proxy. In that case, readObject serves to block this attempt, keeping the attacker from thwarting ImmutableList's immutability guarantee. (This is covered in Effective Java, item 78 in the second edition.)

The SettableFuture seems to be best fit but unfortunately it's declared final. Removing this restriction makes it much more reusable..cpovirk: The class you're looking for is AbstractFuture. I will add some doc to SettableFuture to point there. (We currently have doc on ListenableFuture, so I may just add a pointer back there.)
Another thing we need to do is figure out our recommendations for extending AbstractFuture. Our hope is that users will rarely have to override cancel() (which doesn't always get invoked on cancellation, surprisingly enough: #1958 #1905). In many cases, all you need is to override interruptTask(). For cases in which that is not enough, we are probably going to expose a done() hook for users to override (#2075).
I'll leave this request open until I at least add the doc..kvr000: Thanks for mentioning interruptTask(), this is definitely better than overriding full cancel() method.
However, I still need both the cancel() and set() / setException() method. I actually think that this is pretty common use case for asynchronous tasks that are finished not by returning from method but after some notification is delivered (e.g. another ListentableFuture, completion callback etc.). In such case I need future for which it's possible to set the result and custom method for interrupting the task.
I believe that SettableFuture is best candidate here. Is there any drawback by making it non-final?.cpovirk: cancel(), set(), and setException() are all available on AbstractFuture, too. (I haven't formed a full picture of your requirements, but I'm confident that anything that can be done with SettableFuture can be done with AbstractFuture.)
But I guess I have been dodging the question :) A reason for SettableFuture to be final is that it gives us freedom to perform optimizations. Well, OK, for that particular optimization, we need only get() to be final, not cancel(). But we want to leave ourselves the freedom to do additional optimizations in the future. In fact, this get()-based optimization is new for Guava 19, so if we had permitted overriding of arbitrary methods, we would have prevented ourselves from introducing it. We also have the freedom to make other changes besides optimizations. (I don't remember if this has been important for SettableFuture yet, but that's the general principle at work. And again, for people who do need to extend the type, we provide AbstractFuture, so we're just pushing users to take a slightly different approach.).kvr000: Well, I see the point that with current design it can save some execution time in rather special situations though I can't judge how common they are in guava or the software based on this.
However, as you mentioned - this is mainly about optimizing get(), not cancel()... I think marking get() as final in TrustedFuture would make it safer, more readable and clear on purpose and on the other hand wouldn't affect extendability of TrustedFuture and as a result the inherited classes would take advantage of those performance optimizations as well :-)
Personally I agree it's not a big deal to inherit it from AbstractFuture in exactly the same way how SettableFuture is currently implemented. But I don't like I have to reinvent the wheel / duplicate the code. So maybe we can consider introducing another intermediate class AbstractSettableFuture and final SettableFuture. Although as described above it probably would hardly bring any value from the originally proposed approach.
Additionally, I'm considering implementing a Future class where in case of code is already running and cancellation is requested, get() and listener processing would be called after set()/setException() methods are called instead of immediately after invoking cancel(). Do you think it would be worth merging into guava or shall I skip the step for this? :-).cpovirk: I've added some documentation to SettableFuture.
When you refer to ""duplicating the code,"" are you talking about duplicating the overrides of set and setException that exist only to make them accessible? Often this ends up being unnecessary if you call the methods from within your AbstractFuture subclass.
To your cancel() request, I think you're describing a Future that diverges from the Future spec. That spec requires that the Future be done when cancel() returns..kvr000: Yes, I'm talking about duplicating set and setException. If I was able to inherit from SettableFuture it would save me few common lines of code. I need to call them externally as in this case it's basically used to implement integration pattern between 3rd-party framework and guava based code. I.e. (simplified version) 3rdparty.method().addListener((Future<?> updatedFuture) -> { guavaFuture.set(updatedFuture.get()); })
For the cancel() request - I don't think it's somehow in conflict with specification. The specification only says that isDone() must return true and isCancelled() true as well but doesn't say when. And actually as the future is handled asynchronously by listener anyway it doesn't make any difference when you really ""finish"" the future..cpovirk: If the need to redeclare set and setException is distasteful, you can put your 3rdparty.method().addListener call inside your AbstractFuture subclass, probably declared inside your MyThirdPartyUsingService class. This might turn out to be the simplest place to define your subclass, anyway, to keep the set and cancel logic near one another.
RE: ""subsequent calls to isDone() will always return true"": I think that the natural reading of ""always"" is ""at any time,"" not ""after some arbitrary future time."" Otherwise, all the statement would be saying is ""Once the Future is done, it's always done,"" and that doesn't seem like something to document on cancel()..kvr000: That would be even worse because I would lose reusability of such class. And secondly I understand the original purpose of SettableFuture as the creating code doesn't yet know who and how updates the future. Otherwise it could be rather called Forwarded which in this case is just the listener.
RE: ""subsequent calls to¬†isDone()will always return true"": But it still does. The only difference is that listeners invocation is postponed until the task is finished (if it already runs). The state of future would be always CANCELLED since the completion of cancel()and all the affected methods would return proper value..cpovirk: You seem to be suggesting that the isDone concept of ""completed"" (""Returns true if this task completed"") has no connection to the concept of ""completed"" used elsewhere in the Future docs (""The result can only be retrieved using method get when the computation has completed"").
Returning to SettableFuture and final: I regret that I haven't formed a clear enough picture of how SettableFuture would be used in your code to be more helpful. As far as the feature request goes, though, the Guava team is satisfied with AbstractFuture as a solution here..kvr000: Never mind. I can either copy the setters or base the code on spring SettableListenableFuture which is more open in these terms.
Thanks anyway.",2015-10-10T20:33:20Z,2015-10-13T17:47:03Z,1,0,3

Added a vararg overload for firstNonNull,cla: yes,,,"paplorinc: Avoiding nullability in Java is a recurring problem.
Other languages offer an Optional, which makes nullability composable.
This however is very verbose in Java and cannot consistently be inserted into an existing, nullable codebase (especially since the Optional can be null also).
Guava tries to simplify some of the common cases, e.g. we have a value, but if it's not set, we want a default (but the same can be true for the default).
Unfortunately this method wasn't called defaultIfNull, but firstNonNull, therefore people assumed it's a search.
This commit tries to solve that by making it a search, and letting the users decide which approach they want:
ternary,
(first != null) ? first : ((second != null) ? second : checkNotNull(third));
Find,
Iterables.find(asList(first, second, third), Predicates.notNull());
Optional,
Optional.fromNullable(first).or(second).or(third).get();

‚Ä?Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub..googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!.dant3: How is it different from Optional approach besides not creating an Optional instance?
Optional.fromNullable(name).transform(n -> n.toUpperCase()).or("""");.paplorinc: Hello @dant3,
The point of this modification is to provide an alternative for Optional for another very common case.
The same as for Guava's firstNonNull, e.g. instead of
    Optional.fromNullable(first).or(second).get();
we can choose (this is the keyword here) to simply call
    firstNonNull(first, second);    
Which delimits the different parts of the computation way better, than Optional could.
The same applies to this changeset also, e.g. instead of
    Optional.fromNullable(name).transform(n -> n.toUpperCase()).or("""");
we can choose to simply call
    ifNonNull(name, n -> n.toUpperCase(), """");
Which keeps the bare essentials only.
ps. I statically imported MoreObject, because its methods are stateless and have meaning without the surrounding object, unlike Optional, where simply calling fromNullable(first) would look unintuitive..paplorinc: (related to #2164).zsolt-donca: I like the general idea presented here, as there definitely are use cases when the above-defined ifNonNull would be the preferable choice.
What is the expected behavior when thenFunction returns null? Should ifNonNull return

null (the current behavior),
throw an exception, like the Optional.transform does in the above example
elseValue, like the equivalent of the above example would do if it was using java.util.Optional from Java 8..lowasser: I'm not sure we're ready to accept new features that are dependent on Java 8, in the sense that if you're working with Java 7, this is much less readable than the ""conventional"" code you would write with a perfectly normal ternary or if statement..paplorinc: @zsolt-donca, very good observations, thanks, will apply them.
@lowasser, I understand your concern, and would like to add a few comments:

Guava has many methods that look horrible with Java 7, e.g.

Integer find(List<Integer> inputs) {
  return Iterables.find(inputs, new Predicate<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public boolean apply(Integer input) {
      return input == 2;
    }
  });
}
but can be replaced with simple constructs, e.g.
Integer find(List<Integer> inputs) {
  for (Integer input : inputs)
    if (input == 2) return input;  
  throw new NoSuchElementException();
}
or
Iterables.find(inputs, Predicates.equalTo(2))
The same is true in this case, i.e. one could still extract commonly used functions and use them in a similar manner.
ifNonNull(person.getName(), Strings.toUpperCase(), """");

The other argument is a more subjective one. Idea already presents these cases as if it were lambda style, making it more terse in reality than the variable&ternary style, i.e. instead of:

String name = person.getName();
if (name != null)
  name = name.toUpperCase();
if (name == null)
  name = """";
we can still see in the IDE
name = ifNonNull(person.getName(), (n) ‚Ü?{ return n.toUpperCase(); }, """");

And as a closing argument, in my personal opinion, Guava could really complement Java 8's shortcomings in more ways than it does now.
Not providing useful functionality because in a deprecated Java version the syntax is uglier, is a pitty..cgdecker: Personally, I feel that Optional is a much better way to approach this. firstNonNull preceded the existence of our Optional class and has the advantage of being very simple to understand. I think when you get into something like this ifNotNull(T, Function, R) it becomes much less obvious to readers what you're doing, whereas Optional.fromNullable(value).transform(function).or(fallback) is pretty clear.
Thanks for the idea, but I'm fairly certain this isn't an API we want to add, so I'm going to close this. For future reference, if you want to see an API added or changed it's better to start by just opening an issue for discussion of it.

Use thread-local buffers to avoid memory allocation and improve performance,cla: yes,jbduncan,,"berndhopp: Abstract
goal of this PR is to replace
byte[] buf = new byte[BUF_SIZE];
ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

with
Buffers.Lease<byte[]> lease = Buffers.leaseByteArray();

try{
   byte[] buffer = lease.getBuffer();
} finally {
    lease.returnLease();
}

Buffers.Lease<ByteArrayOutputStream> lease = Buffers.leaseByteArrayOutputStream();

try{
   ByteArrayOutputStream baos = lease.getBuffer();
} finally {
    lease.returnLease();
}



in all cases where byte-array or ByteArrayOutputStreams are used method-internal, this way avoiding unneccessary memory allocation, increasing performance and enhancing the memory profile.
Implementation
[ThreadLocalBuffers](https://github.com/berndhopp/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/io/
Buffers.java) is the manager of thread-local byte-arrays and FastByteArrayOutputStreams. It uses SoftReferences or WeakReferences to store buffers, this way enabling Garbage Collection to collect the buffers when the system runs low on memory. All allocations of byte[] or ByteArrayOutputStream in where the allocated byte[]/BAOS is not the returned value of the method have been replaced with calls to ThreadLocalBuffers.
ByteSource.contentEquals was challenging, because it used not one but two byte-arrays for buffering, so I used two ByteBuffers that wrap around the upper and lower part of the thread-local buffer, thereby mimicking the two buffers.
Results
The microbenchmarks show that avoiding buffer allocation yields a significant performance boost. Tests that did not show significant differences are left out. There have been no tests where performance dropped more than 2.00%.

ByteSourceBenchmark w/out ThreadLocal.lukesandberg: I think both SoftReferences and ThreadLocals can create issues

SoftReferences can induce poor gc behavior where (iirc) it takes 2 full gc for a softreference to be collected.  I believe the general advice is ""don't use them, ever""
ThreadLocals can cause issues in certain application containers to leak classloaders.  I believe it is possible to workaround... i don't remember how.

Since preallocated buffers are such a win, the better option is probably to modify these apis so that users can supply their own buffer (which they could manage with a ThreadLocal+SofReference or whatever is appropriate).berndhopp: Hi Luke, thank you for your comment.
It is often advised not to use ThreadLocals in webapplications (like here ) since webapplications typically use thread-pools and so threads never actually finish, leaving objects threadlocal-attached to a thread to never be collected by gc. However in this case, since we only store Soft-/WeakReferences, garbage collection is able to free the buffer-memory (except for the tiny SoftReference-Object itself),  thus avoiding the problem alltogether.
As for the SoftReference-issue, are you referring to http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6912889 ? To circumvent this issue, it would be enough to just replace SoftReference with WeakReference, since WeakReference does not cause these problems, but it would come with some performance penalty. Maybe a good solution would be to use WeakReferences only for all ByteArrayOutputStreams and byte-arrays larger than the initial size of 8k, since you need to fill the heap up almost completely with softreferenced memory to cause the problem, what is hardly possible with 8k per thread.
Also, guava uses SoftReferences in other places too, like http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/cache/CacheBuilder.html#softValues().
Regards
Bernd
Update:
after some more googling, I found this ( I guess that is what you referred to, concerning the threadlocals ): https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/MemoryLeakProtection#customThreadLocal
So I will rewrite the code to not use custom ThreadLocals.
Update 2:
I implemented what I mentioned above here:
not using custom ThreadLocals
using WeakReferences for byte-arrays larger than init-size
using WeakReferences for ByteArrayOutputStreams
to my surprise, the code has gotten more elegant with the changes IMHO :-).Maaartinus: AFAIK, there's already such a leak in com.google.common.escape.Platform, which could be fixed trivially by avoiding initialValue..berndhopp: @Maaartinus exactly, I removed the overriding of initialValue here.berndhopp: @15characterlimi ok, thanks for the update.berndhopp: Hi @15characterlimi, any news here?.cgdecker: Sorry for how long this has taken, @berndhopp.
I'm going to take a look at the details of this and try to have a concrete response for you soon. I will say that my initial inclination is that this isn't something we want to do in Guava: I think reuse of buffers is a bit of a fraught issue and one that should be explicitly under the user's control, which would really require a different API design than our libraries currently have. But again, I'll try to respond more specifically soon..berndhopp: @cgdecker thanks for your answer. I'm a bit puzzled right now what the concerns are. Buffer reuse is a tricky task where you can do a lot of things wrong, it took me quite a lot of effort to come up with an implementation that is safe even when the same thread uses a buffer on different levels of the stack trace. Also, there is not really any good alternative algorithm or approach to the problem; if you want buffer reuse to be efficient, save and free of memory leaks, you will inevitably wind up with ThreadLocals, Weak-/SoftReferences and some sort of 'Lease' concept to avoid reuse by the same thread. Feel free to disagree on these points I mentioned, I'm willing to discuss them. But my point is: if you have a patch that increases performance in every possible scenario without any api break or side effects whatsoever, why would a user need more 'control' over it? I just cannot think of any scenario where a user-supplied buffer would make more sense than my implementation. It may outperform my implementation by a small margin if the user would cache a buffer in say a HttpSession, but there is just too much that could go wrong.
If your concerns are that it 'looks' somewhat fragile and hard to test properly, I can totally understand that, but that is just the nature of the beast in this case..jbduncan: My concern about this is I don't know if thread-local buffers are thread-safe when used with libraries that introduce radically different concurrency models to the JVM, like Parallel Universe's Quasar with it's so-called ""fibers"" (or lightweight threads), or Akka with it's actor model..berndhopp: Both Quasar and Akka rely on plain old threads eventually, so the concurrency models may be different but they base on the same building blocks. In http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/ is says:
""Using ThreadLocals in a fiber works as you‚Äôd expect ‚Ä?the values are local to the fiber.""
Because a fiber is nothing but a wrapped Thread at the end of the day. Every concurrency library out there is based on plain old threads and ThreadLocal cannot be ""tricked"" out of working, so there is nothing to worry about. As long as every code execution in java happens in the context of a java thread, ThreadLocals will work and this patch will work..wikier: To learn from this PR and understand the background, while is still open? The feature request looks like a good idea to me. I'd need to dive deep in the implementation to provide further feedback. But what I still don't understand why is not closed (as merge or simply closed), at least not open forever..cgdecker: Sorry for letting this fall off my radar. While I think buffer reuse can be useful, I don't think the way Guava's I/O utilities are designed lends itself to this. Because ByteStreams and CharStreams are all static methods, there is no (good) way for the user to have control over caching behavior. I want to avoid mutable static state like the lease provider map in Buffers. And I generally don't like the idea of potentially holding on to a buffer for each (reused) thread that has ever used one, which could add up to quite a bit, without the user having control over that.
A different design for the package where, say, you instead have an instance of your utility class and can pass in some kind of buffer cache when creating it (which could use thread locals or some kind of pool or nothing) would work better for something like this, but we most likely won't be making a change like that to common.io anytime soon, if ever.
These are my main issues with the idea of trying to do buffer reuse in Guava in general. I think that if we were to do some kind of (non-user-configurable) buffer reuse, though, I'd want it to be something  considerably simpler than what's in this PR currently, and something that has a strict bound on the amount of memory it holds on to. For example, for many applications I'd bet that you could get a significant percent of the benefit by by just using an AtomicReference<byte[]> or a fixed size BlockingQueue<byte[]> and letting each place that needs a buffer try to take that one and just make a new buffer if it's not there. If you have lots of threads doing I/O using Guava at once (web server maybe) there's considerably less benefit, of course..berndhopp: hm, let me reply to this real quick.
I'm a little confused here, as to what the demands actually are. It had been requested that the user has full control, so I introduced the Lease-concept which gives full control by allowing the user to register it's own LeaseProvider-implementation. Now you say if you where to introduce buffer-reuse, it will be non-user-configurable, should be considerably simpler than this PR and has a strict bound on the amount of memory it holds on to. My first approach, that had no Lease-concept, did match all these requirements in the first place. It did not introduce any additional API, it's implementation was considerably simpler and the actual arrays had been soft-referenced in order to let the garbage collection free them in case memory runs low. Letting GC decide when to fee memory is a better approach than limiting the memory-consumption by assumptions or heuristics. GC will always have the best insights on runtime memory needs. AtomicReferences or BlockingQueues won't save you here, because they either introduce idling (if there are not enough buffers for all threads that need one), or eventually you wind up reinventing the very same mechanisms that ThreadLocal<Reference<byte[]>> had to begin with. No benefit either way.
If you where to eventually introduce buffers with the objectives you mentioned, chances are you will either introduce the approach I presented in the beginning, or one that is inferior to that. my 2 cents.",2015-07-19T12:23:19Z,2018-06-27T16:14:40Z,2,0,8
Use thread-local buffers to avoid memory allocation and improve performance,cla: no,,,"berndhopp: Abstract
goal of this PR is to replace the often seen but unneccessary
byte[] buf = new byte[BUF_SIZE];

or
ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();


with thread-local instances of the respective types in all cases where they are used method-internal, this way avoiding unneccessary memory allocation, increasing performance and enhancing the memory profile.
Implementation
ThreadLocalBuffers is the manager of thread-local buffers. It uses SoftReferences to store buffers, this way enabling Garbage Collection to collect the buffers when the system runs low on memory. This class is package-local right now but can eventually be made public for other scenarios where a buffer is needed.
All allocations of byte[] or ByteArrayOutputStream where the allocated byte[]/BAOS was not the returned value of the method have been replaced with calls to ThreadLocalBuffers.
ByteSource.contentEquals was challenging, because it used not one but two byte-arrays for buffering, so I used two ByteBuffers that wrap around the upper and lower part of the thread-local buffer, thereby mimicking the two buffers.
Results
The microbenchmarks show that avoiding buffer allocation yields a significant performance boost.

If you signed the CLA as a corporation, please let us know the company's name..cpovirk: Our current policy is that Guava runs with Java 6+ but that it may require a newer version to build. I would not mind if we fixed this occurrence up, but we currently have no way to prevent future violations. Animal Sniffer, which we use for Java 6 enforcement, seems to work only on the main compile, not the test compile. (I was able to run it only by telling Maven that our test sources were normal sources and that all of our test-only deps were normal deps.) If anyone can figure out a way to run it on the test sources, we'd probably be interested.
[edit: Animal Sniffer starts checking test code in 1.19.]
(Also, see the CLA warning above. If it's something you'd rather not sign, I can submit my own workaround. (This is a problem we've had to confront in ours tests previously where it affected GWT compatibility.)).Sumu-Ning: I thought I have signed the cla, but only after I created the pull request.
Is that the reason, or do I need to sign a different one?.googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!.cpovirk: I guess that the bot just takes a little while to run. Or maybe someone needs to come and say the magic work ""CLA?"" Anyway, looks good now.

Created a Changelog,cla: yes,,,"silentmoose: Created a CHANGELOG in the root directory.

Second, I'm not sure this file adds much value, as a placeholder.  It doesn't include the massive back-fill of change log information, and doesn't provide much structure so it's not really a pull request so much as a documentation request (which is fair, but that's an issue, not a p/r)
Also, we have so much coming out from internal commits, and google's internal commits are usually unique, meaningful changes with a reasonable commit description, that it is nearly certain to be just as valuable to automatically crib the descriptions from the list of commits and use that as a first-draft log of changes.  Maintaining one manually and incrementally may be worth it, but I'm not convinced.
@cgdecker - any opinions?  I'm not sure what you had in mind for release changelogs.  My personal feeling is that we take the full list from the last release and trim it into a changelog.  I do like the idea of demonstrating the delta, the additional features/changes/etc..silentmoose: Appreciate your detailed explanation. I do feel that a changelog that users can quickly skim to see new additions is important. Now as far as actual implementation obviously that does not matter as much to me as the actual active devs..googlebot: CLAs look good, thanks!.ben-manes: fyi, you should consider using Github releases instead of a changelog..cpovirk: I think Colin puts together a pretty good list for each release, e.g.:
https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release21
We also provide automated diffs between the current snapshot and the previous release:
http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/diffs/
We could try to keep a running changelog between releases, but I fear it will never become a high enough priority in comparison to the changes themselves, given the existing things we provide here.",2015-03-07T15:09:03Z,2017-01-30T22:38:18Z,1,1,5
Add a weight() method to Cache,cla: no package=cache,,,"cheddar: Cache objects currently do not have a method of introspecting on the current ""weight"" value.  I am replacing an implementation of a cache that is just a synchronized LinkedHashMap.  In my current implementation of the cache, I'm keeping track of the weights of things being stored and exposing that as a metric about my cache.  This is the only feature of my current implementation that is not covered by Guava's Cache.
From looking at the code, it seemed relatively easy to just create another method parallel to size() to handle this case so I just went ahead and did it.  The guidelines do state that API changes should start as an issue, but I didn't realize that until I had already done this and it is such a simple fix, it doesn't bother me if it gets thrown away (as long as I do get some method of introspecting on the current weight value ;) ).
I do realize that this is a public API change, it is only an addition, but it does mean that if anyone else is implementing the Cache interface from scratch, their code will have to be updated before it can work with this.  I'm not sure what level of API compatibility is maintained with Guava, but as long as people are only using Guava-built cache objects, it should be a forward-compatible change.
Also, I updated unit tests as I could find ones that seemed relevant, but I will admit that I didn't read and comprehend all tests, so I might've missed a good place to add some more verification of the weight computation.  Let me know if there are other tests to update and I'll be happy to.
If you think this is going to work, let me know and I'll make sure to get a CLA..googlebot: Thanks for your pull request.

I'll see if I can repro the failure on my local machine and try to fix, but any pointers to what might cause the gwt compilation to fail would be helpful..cheddar: Ok, on my local machine, I cannot seem to download com.google.guava:guava:java-source:19.0-SNAPSHOT
Looks like it is not in sonatype-nexus-snapshots
So, it's failing, but for a different reason...  I guess I'll wait on fixing that until the discussion of whether this API change could even be considered has happened..ben-manes: The predecessor, ConcurrentLinkedHashMap introduced the concept of weights and provides a weightedSize method. That may be a simpler migration path. (Note: currently moving to Github due to Google Code shutdown)
The JDK8 rewrite, Caffeine, exposes additional inspection including the weighted size through the Policy abstraction. That project is maturing quickly but not yet released..cheddar: @ben-manes So, are you suggesting that instead of using a Cache in my code I use ConcurrentLinkedHashMap?
Can't really use something that isn't released yet :).ben-manes: I'm offering it as an option as your changes may not be accepted and you would have to wait for the next release if they are. If all you need are the basic features of its predecessor, then its a reasonable option. The old wiki is in the Github wiki branch since the migration didn't move it over properly..cpovirk: Bulk closing all pull requests that are listed as needing CLA signing.

Builder to create ThreadPoolExecutor and ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor,cla: no,,,"yanglifan: JDK Executors provides several tool methods to create ThreadPoolExecutor and ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor. But these methods are not flexible. But if build up ThreadPoolExecutor and ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor from nothing, it will be a little complex.
Apache Camel has a ThreadPoolBuilder but it is complex since bind with CamelContext.
So I create a simple builder to create ThreadPoolExecutor and ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor..googlebot: Thanks for your pull request.

Don't use an automatic formatter; format only the lines you change, by hand..kevinb9n: It seems unproductive to try to give a long explanation of what we found unacceptable about eclipse's formatter, when we will be releasing our formatter and you can see the differences for yourself..rpau: Perfect, thanks for recovering my text and answer my questions :).kevinb9n: @rpau your comment was posted four times," so I removed the redundant copies but left one in place.  I wonder if maybe someone else was trying to do that at the same time.  Sorry about that.""",2015-02-12T10:50:14Z,2015-02-12T19:12:49Z,1,0,5
Jdk5 backport v17.0 compatibility,cla: yes,,,"paulduffin: Reverts (at least in part) a number of changes made to jdk5-backport-v17.0-post to make it more compatible with code built against jdk5-backport-v14.0.1-post, specifically AOSP code. The reverted changes added back methods that had been present in v14 (deprecated and not) and since been removed. The intent is to allow AOSP code that built against v14.0.1 to also build against the compatibility version of v17.0 without modification (or with minimal atomic modifications). That will make upgrading itself easier and will allow other changes such as removing usages of deprecated methods to be done in stages..cgdecker: Rather than merging this into jdk5-backport-master, I think I'll just pull it as a separate branch and give it a tag. Running the tests against a JDK5 rt.jar, I found one test in ByteStreamsTest that was calling getBytes(Charset) which didn't exist in JDK5. I'll just add a commit fixing that to the branch..cgdecker: I've pulled the branch in (plus the fix I mentioned) with the tag jdk5-backport-v17.0-compatibility (https://github.com/google/guava/commits/jdk5-backport-v17.0-compatibility).",2015-02-11T14:58:21Z,2015-02-12T18:44:28Z,13,0,4

Increase test heap to 3G.,cla: yes,,,cgdecker: This pull request is just for testing whether increasing the max heap for tests to 3 GB works and solves the problem with the BloomFilter test that's OOMing.,2015-01-21T20:11:59Z,2015-01-22T19:59:40Z,2,1,2
Few lines addition in README.md,cla: yes,,,"vijayk2019: Hello,
If someone is new to guava, it'd be helpful to have more information in README.md. I tried to add some more information in README.md.

NullPointerTester: allow to override the exception type policy,,,,"philipp-classen: NullPointerTester already knows the concept of a ExceptionTypePolicy.
However, the field ""policy"" is always set to a default value.
This patch adds an option to overwrite the policy to
allow IllegalArgumentExceptions. It also adds some unit tests..philipp-classen: Hmm, Travis breaks because of an unrelated error:
testLargeNumberOfInsertions(com.google.common.hash.BloomFilterTest): Java heap space.Stephan202: Apparently even more heap space is necessary. See this commit from yesterday: fa24bad..lowasser: AFAICT, we actually have this already implemented but restricted to @GoogleInternal..philipp-classen: @lowasser Maybe it is called ""acceptIllegalArgumentException""? That is mentioned in the commit message where the ExceptionTypePolicy was extracted (2be3428).
I found the option to accept IllegalArgumentExceptions very useful, especially for existing code. If you can make it non-internally available, it would be great.
By the way, are there any plans to move the NullPointerTester from the internal guava-testlib to the exported part of Guava? From my experience, it is useful for any code base and not limited to Guava itself. Not long ago, I introduced a slightly modified version of it at my company (including this IllegalArgument fix and the  Nullable annotation had to be changed). Today I was positively surprised that it is now being used all over our code base..cgdecker: @philipp-classen We don't actually consider guava-testlib to be ""internal"". Users are free to depend on guava-testlib from their tests; we don't want to include the stuff there in the main guava artifact because depending on utilities intended for testing in non-test code isn't something you want to do generally..philipp-classen: @cgdecker Yes, that makes sense. To be able to depend on guava-testlib is fine, too..kartoffelsup: üëç We are using checkArgument(!Strings.isNullOrEmpty(xyz)) a lot, which is why this addition would be really great. I know it's called NullPointerTester and not PreconditionsTester or something, but if you have it internally, could you 'publish' it? :).kevinb9n: Marvin, isn't it easier to write checkArgument(!xyz.isEmpty())?

I consider the internal support to be an experiment we entered into under
pressure, and I don't see any value having coming from it at all. Is there
a rational reason why different APIs should throw different exceptions in
response to null input? Could one recognize which type of API should be
which? I don't think so; it comes down to mere developer preference, so we
benefit from having a single standard instead, which we've had for well
over a decade.

Add support for Travis CI,,,,"joschi: This changeset adds support for Travis CI as publicly visible means of continuous integration (additionally to the probably internally running CI system at Google).
Travis CI is configured to build Guava with Oracle JDK 7, OpenJDK 7, and OpenJDK 6. Oracle JDK 8 hasn't been added to the list because of the currently unresolved issues with building Guava with Java 8.
In order for this changeset to work, someone with the appropriate permissions on the Guava repository will have to activate the build on Travis CI, see Activate GitHub Webhook..cgdecker: Thanks... as I said on the other pull request, we'll just need you to sign the Google individual CLA before we can accept the change..joschi: I have signed the Google individual CLA..cgdecker: Submitted internally; should be mirrored out soon.",2014-11-03T09:06:22Z,2014-11-05T20:37:13Z,2,2,2
Replace Google Code URLs with corresponding GitHub URLs,,,,"joschi: The guava-parent Maven POM still contains URLs pointing to Google Code for issues and SCM. This changesets updates the respective URLs to their counterparts on GitHub..cgdecker: Thanks! Can you sign the Google individual CLA?
Just FYI, we're going to be handling pull requests by applying the changes internally and then syncing them out rather than by merging the pull request directly. See #1878 for a little more on that..joschi: I have signed the Google individual CLA..cgdecker: LGTM
I've gone ahead and submitted this change internally with the one minor change to use SSH for the <developerConnection> URL. Should be mirrored out shortly. Thanks!",2014-11-03T09:00:02Z,2014-11-05T20:26:19Z,1,0,2
Fix ByteArrayDataInput Javadoc,,,,"Xaerxess: So Guava moved to Github! This is my first (and very small) fix: I spotted improperly closed tag in ByteArrayDataInput's Javadoc. Should be OK now..gk5885: That's awesome.  Even for such a small change, can you fill out https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual ?.gk5885: Also, just to make sure‚Ä? @cgruber and @cgdecker, we have the repository sync working both ways, right?.Xaerxess: No problem, I've just signed individual CLA..cgdecker: @gk5885 I don't think we do have sync working both ways at the moment, unfortunately. If possible I'd definitely like to get it working of course, but I've been under the impression that 2-way syncing is difficult with the google-internal stuff mixed in.
In the meantime I suppose we can handle pull requests by patching in the changes internally... can even set the author of the commit to the right person when syncing out potentially..sameb: FWIW, two-way sync works fine for Guice, though we have limited google-internal things..cgdecker: @Xaerxess Thanks! While we can't merge pull requests directly (see #1878), I merged this change internally and it's been synced out in 1b82532. In the future we should be able to make commits from pull requests actually attributed to you, but we didn't with this one, so sorry about that.",2014-11-01T22:15:18Z,2014-11-04T21:34:23Z,1,1,4
